This is still a work in process.  I don't quite have all the amounts down right.  Last time I made it I used too much oil and salt; hence those don't have measurements below.

      Amount  Measure       Ingredient — Preparation Method
    --------  ------------  --------------------------------
           3  cups          potatoes — rough cubed
                            oil
                            salt
           3  tbsp          mayo
         1/2  tbsp          mustard
         1/2  tsp           ground black pepper

Toss the potato cubes with oil and salt.  Spread out onto a pan, making a single layer. Bake 350℉ for about 45 minutes.  Stirring them up once or twice.  When finished, transfer to a bowl and toss with mayo, mustard, and pepper.  Serve warm.
