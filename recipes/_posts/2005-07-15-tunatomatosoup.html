<p>Was hungry and wanted food fast.  This is what I ended up with, and
it turned out rather well.  (<small>Or maybe I was too hungry to tell...</small>)

<table class="recipe">
<tr><th>Amount</th><th>Measure</th><th>Ingredient</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td>can</td> <td>tomato soup (10oz)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1/2</td> <td>tsp</td> <td>dried basil</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1/4</td> <td>tsp</td> <td>chile pepper flakes</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2/3</td> <td>cup</td> <td>small soup noodles</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td>can</td> <td>tuna (6oz) -- drained</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1/2</td> <td>cup</td> <td>chopped yellow bell pepper</td></tr>

<p>
Dump the tomato soup into a quart pot, fill the soup can with water and add that
as well.  Add the basil, pepper flakes, and noodles.  Bring to a quick boil, 
then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for about 6 minutes.  Add the tuna and 
yellow pepper and simmer uncovered for another couple of minutes.
