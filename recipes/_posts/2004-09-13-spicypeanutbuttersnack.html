<p>
Spread peanut butter onto a tortilla, leaving space around the edges
so it won't squish out.  Toss a few jalapenos on top, and cover with another
tortilla.  Squish it down a bit so the peanut butter holds the two tortillas
together and keeps the jalapenos in.
</p>
<p>Note: Lacking Jalapenos, you can use salsa, but that's really messy.</p>
