      Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
    --------  ------------  --------------------------------
         1/4  cup           onion -- diced
         1/2  lb            sausage links -- cut into bite sized pieces
     about 4  cups          kale -- torn from steams into bite sized pieces (4 fluffy cups)
          14  oz            canned diced tomatoes with garlic and onion
                            pasta -- which ever you're apt to like

Cook sausage and onions until sausage done and onions soft.  Move to a covered dish.  Put kale into pan and a splash of water.  Cook until wilted; a minute or two.  Add the can of diced tomatoes.  Cook until heated thru.  Add to the sausage and onion.


Use a slotted spoon to serve over cooked pasta.

Note: Chicken cut into bite sized bits instead of sausage also works well.
