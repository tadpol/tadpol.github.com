      Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
    --------  ------------  --------------------------------
         1/2  lb            chicken breast -- cut into bite sized chunks
         1/2  cup           onion -- sliced into rings and then quartered
           3  cloves        garlic -- minced
         1/2  tsp           dried basil
                            salt
                            chile pepper flakes
         1/2  cup           green bell pepper -- sliced like the onions
           4  cups          chicken broth
         1/4  lb            angle hair pasta
         1/2  cup           frozen corn
           2  tbsp          flour
           2  tbsp          olive oil
         1/2  tbsp          soy sauce
         1.5  cups          soy milk


Put the chicken breast pieces and onion into a 2 quart pot and cook at medium heat until onion starts to become transparent. (you might need a little oil to keep from sticking, might not.)  Then add the garlic and basil; then salt and chile pepper flakes to taste.  Add the green bell pepper. Stir this up and let it cook for about a minute.

Add the broth, and bring up the heat to get it to a boil.  Once boiling, add the pasta. (you may want to break the noodles into smaller pieces.)  Cover and turn heat down to a simmer.  Let this simmer for about 6 minutes.

While that is simmering, mix the flour, oil, and soy sauce in a small bowl or measuring cup.  Slowly add the soy milk to the paste, stirring to keep an even consistency.

When the noodles are soft, add the corn.  If you are using frozen corn, give it a minute or two over medium heat to defrost the corn.  Then add the flour soy milk mixture, stirring well.
