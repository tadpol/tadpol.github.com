	       1  lb            chicken thighs -- boneless and skinless
	       1  cup           uncooked rice
	       2  cups          chicken broth
	     1/2  cup           sour cream (real or non-dairy)
	       6  oz            mushroom slices


Pre heat the oven to 375°F.

Mix the broth and sour cream until even in a 9x9 baking dish.  Add the rice and mushrooms and lightly mix. Place the chicken on top and push down so the liquids slightly cover.

Cover and bake for about 40 minutes.  Check the chicken with a thermometer, thighs should be at 170°F.
Uncover and bake a little longer if you want the top to brown a bit.
