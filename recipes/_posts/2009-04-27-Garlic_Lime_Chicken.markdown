	       1  lb            chicken — boneless
	       1                lime
	  5 to 7  cloves        garlic — crushed
	                        coarse salt


Cut chicken into thin strips, somewhere between ⅛ and ¼ inch thick.

Put the chicken and crushed garlic in a container. Then squeeze all the juice out of the lime into the container. Finish with a couple pinches of salt. Mix well and refrigerate for about an hour.

Lightly oil a frying pan (cast iron works best I think) and heat on medium until oil get shimmery.  Dump all of the chicken, garlic and lime mixture.  Cook, stirring very occasionally until all moisture is gone and chicken starts to brown.

This isn't really meant to stand on its own, but rather as an ingredient to some Mexican or Asian dish.
