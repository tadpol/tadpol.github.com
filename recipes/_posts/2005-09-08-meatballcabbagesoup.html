<p>I'm always a little leery of things that I wake up at 3AM and write down, but this turned out
to be not too bad when I tried it the next day.
</p>

<table class="recipe">
<tr><th>Amount</th><th>Measure</th><th>Ingredient</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1/3</td> <td>pound</td> <td>ground beef</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td></td> <td>egg</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1/2</td> <td>cup</td> <td>bread crumbs</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1/2</td> <td>tbsp</td> <td>Worcester sauce</td></tr>

    <tr><td>4</td> <td>cups</td> <td>beef broth</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td></td> <td>potato - cubed</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td>cup</td> <td>shredded cabbage</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1/4</td> <td>tsp</td> <td>ground black pepper</td></tr>

<p>
Mix ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, Worcester sauce and salt well.  Form into meatballs that are about a quarter in diameter.  Put meat balls, and a cup of beef broth into 2qt pot and bring to a boil.  Drop back to a simmer, and and cook covered until meatballs are cooked.
</p>
<p>
Remove meatballs, add potatoes and remaining broth.  Simmer until potatoes are almost done, then add cabbage.  Simmer until cabbage is tender.  Return meatballs to soup.  Adjust salt and pepper to taste.
