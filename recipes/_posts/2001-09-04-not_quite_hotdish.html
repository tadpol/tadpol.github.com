<p>
Fill a 2-quart sauce pan half full of water, bring to a boil, add noodles.
Cook until tender. Then pour them out into stainer.
</p><p>
Reduce heat to medium-low, and put thawed meat into the same pan.  Brown,
adding salt and pepper to taste.
(<small>Don't drain off the fat, you need this to make the gravy.</small>)
</p><p>
Add flour.  Stir a bit to coat everything, 
then add the broth and the red pepper sauce.  Up the heat a bit.
Stir this until it starts to thicken.
</p><p>
Add mushrooms and frozen veges.  Heat until entire mass is warmed.
</p><p>
Add noodles back and serve.
</p><p>
If you're lazy, just use the spoon to eat right out of pan.
</p><p>
I usually add the salt to the water of the noodles, instead of to the meat.
But either way works.  And 1/4 ground beef is also one frozen hamburger
patty, which is what I use.
</p><p>
And its not quite hot dish because you didn't put it in the oven.
Unless you live out side of Minnesota, USA.  Then I'm not sure what it isn't.
Also, I stopped using Cream of Mushroom soup, because I would sometimes have a 
lactose reaction to it and sometimes not.  And just got irritated with not knowing
what to expect.
