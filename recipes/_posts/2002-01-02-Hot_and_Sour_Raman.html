<p>
Fill a 2-quart sauce pan two-thirds full of water.  Add the onion, the
vinegar, tabasco, sugar, and the seasoning packet that came with the
raman.  Heat over medium high until it starts boil.  Add the ham and
mushrooms.  Break the raman noodles up some and add them.  Keep boiling
until the noodles get soft.  Turn off the heat and drop in the frozen
peas.  Stir until peas have been heated.  Serve.

Dropping the frozen peas into the soup after turning off the heat does a
nice trick in bringing the soup down from boiling to eatable
temperatures.

This makes 2-3 tadpol servings, which seems to translate to about 4-6
normal servings.
