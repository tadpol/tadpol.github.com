<p>I had my mind all set to make some ginger snaps, only to discover
that I was lacking molasses.  But instead of losing hope, I used honey.
(<small>Its sorta is the same, sticky, sweet syrup stuff.  right?</small>)

<p>
Mix together shortening, sugar, egg, and honey.  Sift remaining
ingredients together and add.  Chill dough.
</p><p>  
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</p><p>  
Roll dough into balls about the size of large walnuts. Place about
3 inches apart on non-stick baking sheets. Bake until just set, not
hard, about 8-10 minutes.  Cookies will be lightly browned.  
(<small>I usually have to wait a minute or two after pulling them out 
of the oven for the cookies to be firm enough to transfer to cooling 
racks.</small>)
