<p>Blend the four and oil together well. Add the broth, and mix.
Add the sage, thyme, and as much salt as you like. (I usually skip the salt,
as the broth is salty enough)
Put into a small sauce pan and heat on medium until thick.  Remove from heat.
Tear the bread into bite sized pieces and add, stirring until bread is well coated
with the gravy.

<p>I call it &ldquo;filling&rdquo; beacuse it tastes like stuffing, but isn't.
