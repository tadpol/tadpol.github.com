      Amount  Measure       Ingredient — Preparation Method
    --------  ------------  --------------------------------
         1/4  cup           oatmeal
         1/4  cup           whole wheat flour
         1/4  cup           unbleached wheat flour
         1/2  tsp           salt
           1  tsp           baking powder
           1                large egg — beaten
        ~1/2  cup           water

Put a medium size fry pan onto medium-low heat. (<small>about 10 inches</small>)  Mix the first five ingredients well.   Add the egg and water to form a batter.  You may need a bit more or less water depending on the size of the egg.  When the pan is hot enough that water drops dance when dropped onto it, add the batter.  When edges look dry and bubbles stop coming up, flip.

This makes one largish piece, which I cut into four pieces and make open faced sandwiches

If you wanted, you could add a tablespoon or two of sugar, and have a pancake.
