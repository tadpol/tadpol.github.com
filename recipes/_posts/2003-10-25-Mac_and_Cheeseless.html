<p>Cook noodles.</p>
<p>
While noodles are cooking, mix flour and oil in a bowl until smooth. Add
soy creamer and mix well.  It won't mix perfectly, but that's ok.  Add
salt if you want here.
</p><p>
Once noodles are done, dump them out into a strainer.
</p><p>
Turn heat down to medium, and pour the mixture into the pan you cooked
the noodles in and start stirring. (<small>The hot pan will cause the 
mixture to start thickening immediately and unevenly.</small>)
</p><p>
Keep stirring until it is quite thick.  You will probably have to lift
the pan of off the heat a couple of times so you can stir the thinner
stuff down.
</p><p>
This bit doesn't take much more than a minute.  If you let the pan cool
a bit and use a lower heat setting, it still works, but takes longer.
(<small>and is less likely to mess up too.</small>)

Stir in cooked macaroni noodles.
