	  Amount  Measure       Ingredient â€” Preparation Method
	--------  ------------  --------------------------------
	       1  lb            ground beef
	       2  cups          salsa -- pick one you like
	       2  cups          tomato sauce
	                        black olives -- sliced
	      14  oz            refried beans
	       1                zucchini -- sliced
	                        salt
	                        lasagna noodles

	

Brown the beef with a pinch of salt.  Drain it if needed.  Add the salsa, tomato sauce, and black olives.  Mix well.



In a 9x13x2 pan, put a third of the meat mixture. Followed by a layer of noodles.  Cover that with the refried beans. Then the zucchini, sprinkled lightly with salt.  Another third of the meat mixture, a layer of noodles, and the rest of the meat mixture.



I avoid dairy since it makes me sick, but if I didn't there would definitely be cheese on the top here.



Bake covered, at 350 for about 30 minutes. Then uncovered for about 15, and let it set for about 15 more before serving.
