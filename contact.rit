<p>
So you&#8217;ve decided that you need to get ahold of me.
Neat.
</p><p>
Well, I have collected quite a few different methods available for just this purpose.
By far the most reliable method is to 
<a id="emaillink" href="">send email</a>.
<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
        var data=new Array(
                93,81,89,92,68,95,10,68,
                81,84,64,95,92,112,68,81,
                84,64,95,92,30,95,66,87,
                48,48,92,89,94,91,48
        );
        var idx=0, n=data[data.length-1];
        var foo="";
        while( data[idx]!=n ) {
                foo += String.fromCharCode(data[idx++]^n);
        }
        $("#emaillink").attr('href', foo);
-->
</script>
</p>


<p>If you&#8217;re seeking a more interactive interface, you can try to find me on one
of the IM systems.  Google Talk is my preferred IM interface, so try that first. 
(<small>I don't remember when I last logged into some of theseâ€¦</small>)
</p>

<p>

</table>
</p>

<p>And then there are a bunch of sites that know way too much about me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/tadpol" >LinkedIn<a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/tadpol">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/tadpol">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/tadpol">LibraryThing</a></li>
</ul>

<!--
The man you sent out to die is dead
I am not him.
I took his body for my own
I took his memories with his body
and with those came his rage
his anger.
I remember who cast him out
I remember what he wanted to do
His rage eats my existance
I must clean his rage
I must clear his rage.
-->
<p>
Of course, if you know me in the real world, you can find me there too.
If not, well the methods above will have to do.
