<h1>Day 7 &mdash; 18 June 2005</h1>

<p>Couple of us went over to the Harbor Master's office, and made good use of 
the showers. (<small>A hot shower after a week of cold rainy days feels 
<b>wonderful</b>.</small>)  Then grabbed a picture of the Captain, his family, and
the crew.  Then off to the airport to head back home.
</p>
<p>This was truly a wonderful trip 
(<small>in spite of the weathers attempts otherwise.</small>)
