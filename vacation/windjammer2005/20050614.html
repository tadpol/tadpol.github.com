<h1>Day 3 &mdash; 14 June 2005</h1>

<img src="images/IMG_1225.jpg" align=left>
<p>Today, the weather decided it had been far too nice the day before.  It was
quite cloudy in the early morning, then it rained.  And kept raining until well
after dark came.  The main sail was reefed, since there was lots of gusty wind 
on this day.  Even so, I spent most of the day outside on deck.  The scenery was 
just to beautiful to say inside. (<small>This is what rain coats and pants are
made for anyways.</small>)  Still peeked my camera out of the mid-ship hatch
for a quick picture.

<p>Once we dropped anchor, the crew put up tarps, tenting in the deck so it was
drier on deck.  The tarps made the deck look interesting, so I grabbed a shot 
of that.
