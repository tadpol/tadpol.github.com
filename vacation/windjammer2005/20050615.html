<h1>Day 4 &mdash; 15 June 2005</h1>

<p>No rain this day, but some heavy mist, and cold.  Very cold.  Was up early
again, I'm pretty sure I can hear when the cook starts the stove to make coffee.
(<small>They had very good coffee on board, definitely worth getting up for.</small>)
Anchor dug itself in good over night, it was a lot of work to get it out. 
Sailed under a suspension bridge. The perspective making it look like the top
of the masts were about to hit the bridge.

<p>After dropping anchor, we scooted to shore to check out the 
<a href="http://www.woodenboat.com/">Wooden Boat School</a>.  Pretty neat place.
