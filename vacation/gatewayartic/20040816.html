<h1>Day 3 &mdash; 2004/08/16</h1>

<p>Drive off to Manley, taking a stop for a short five-ish mile hike near
the White Mountains. (<small>grrr, this trail had a name, I didn't write
it down though. evilly.</small>) </p>

<p>Then towards the end of the trail, we vered off a bit and got to do a
little hiking on tundra.  Tundra is really spongy, it feels much like
walking on your bed.  When you see you foot hit, the ground can give a
couple inches or more before it stops.  It does not completely give out
though, the closer that your foot comes to where it will stop, the
slower it goes.  (<small>Go walk on your bed, it will be so much clearer
than anything I try to explain here.</small>) When we got to the top of
the nearby hill, we stopped for lunch before heading back.</p>

<p>Two events on the final drive to Manley after hiking.  We have a moose
spotting next to the road. (</small>taking pictures through van glass
makes for odd colorings.</small>) and then a flat!  Durring which we
happily played fresby while trying not to bean the guides while they
changed the tire.</p>

<p>Then we got to Manley and setup camp in the city park.</p>
