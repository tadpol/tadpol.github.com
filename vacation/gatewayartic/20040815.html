<h1>Day 2 &mdash; 2004/08/15</h1>

<p>After leaving the hotel, we stopped quick at the Creamery fields to
check out the flocks of migrating cranes.  Also saw many geese and ducks
as well.</p>

<p>Then for our first hike, we stopped at the Angle Rocks trail head in
the Chena River State park.  We stopped for lunch atop a hill, then
continued on to Chena Hot Springs Resort.  In all, about eight miles, in
land scapes that are far hillier than I am used to.  I was quite happy
to see the end of the trail arrive. </p>

<p>It has been warmer than one would expect for Alaska in August.  (<small>middle to upper 80s F.</small>)
I opted not to jump in the hot springs here, taking advantage of the last shower for a while was good enough for me.
