Short ride on houseboat this morning to get closer to 50 Mile Creek.  Again, paddled upstream as far as we could, before beaching kayaks, and hiking a bit further.

After stopping for lunch, we hiking into narrows, and up a ways until we came across a small waterfall.  (<small>The ledge there is about six feet high.</small>)  Relaxed there a bit, then all the way back to camp for supper.
