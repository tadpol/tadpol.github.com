Got up early for an excursion to [North Cape](http://www.visitnorthcape.no/).  This is the northernmost point in Norway. (<small>well, second most actually, but not by much, and this point is more scenic than the other one. So it got all the tourism.</small>)

Then we took a long bus ride down to Hammerfest to catch up with the ferry again.  On the way we got to see reindeer.  Since it was a warm day, the reindeer like to hide in cool places.  The tunnels for the roads proved to be nice and cool, so the reindeer would swarm the openings in places.

This all happened before noon.  Which meant having nothing to do but lie about and watch the scenery go by all afternoon was quite nice.
