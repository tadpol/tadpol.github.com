Slept way in today, had a late breakfast with Bj&oslash;rn and Bente, then into Bergen to do some sightseeing.

First we took a tram, [Fl&oslash;ibanen](http://www.floibanen.com/), up to a lookout spot over most of Bergen.

Then after we got back down we wondered through a [fishmarket](http://www.bergen-guide.com/40.htm) while being rained on.  And then through [Bryggen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryggen) before checking out the [Aquarium](http://www.akvariet.no/).
<br clear="all" />

After that we went back to Bj&oslash;rn's place for supper and then got ready for the train ride from Bergen to Oslo.
