<h1>Day 8 &mdash 2003/02/01</h1>

<h2>First Landing: Half Moon Island</h2>

<p>
Chinstrap penguins here instead of gentoos.  Still a huge colony, and
all that goes with it.  There was also a bunch of fur seals too around
the island as well.
</p>

<p>
Kinda funny, someone had a small tripod, and was filming a fur seal. 
And the seal charged, so he jumped away, leaving his camera.  The
following twenty minutes were spent is a bit of an edging dance trying
to get close enough to his camera to get it back, and not close enough
to the seal for it to charge again.
(<small>Sometimes the other passengers are as entertaining as the
wildlife.</small>)

On a short cruise after leaving the island, went out to an ice berg and
watched some chinstraps on it.
Got a neat picture of a chinstrap jumping onto the ice berg too.

<h2>Second Landing: </h2>

<p>
  Was sleeping when the called out for the last couple of zodiacs
leaving.  So I had to rush to get my gear on.  This lead to me being in
the last zodiac.  And since the <a href="http://www.iaato.org/">IAATO</a>
 states to only allow 100 visitors at
a time to an area, we went out on a cruise for a while.  Saw some neat
stuff, but the best part was the Macaroni that we came across.
</p>
<p>
    We were on this cruise a bit longer than we should have been, since
the driver's radio battery died.  And the rest thought we were lost
until he changed batteries and could contact them back.

<p>
  Also while we were heading back, we hit a wave, and since I was in the
front I got nailed with a splashed wave of sea water.  That was cold.
</p>
<p>
The guides have stated many times how unusually wonderful the weather we
have had was.  We made all of the landings, plus and extra one.  This is
nearly unheard of.
</p><p>
  Most of us are hoping that we will not get paid back when we cross the
Drake Passage again.
