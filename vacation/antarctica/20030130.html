Woke up at 6:00 to a massive thunk followed by a grating sound.  Peeking
out the porthole in my room, all I could see was ice chunks.  So I
bolted up and got clothing on and rushed outside to take some pictures.
I had thought to sleep in today, guess not. Even so, seeing the ship
surrounded by ice chunks was worth getting up early.

<h2>First landing: Vernadsky Base and Wordie Hut</h2>

<p>No penguins here. (<small>Yes, that is suprising enough to
note.</small>)</p>

<p>Wordie Hut is yet another leftover British base.  There was a guest
log here though, and I signed in with everyone else.  This base is
occasionally used by the people of the nearby base when the want to get
away from the others for a bit.

<p>Saw two things in the Wordie hut that caught my eye.  A Guinness sign
and a strange device next to a typewriter.  Anyone know what that thing
with the glass ball is?</p>

Vernadsky Base is a Ukrainian station.  It used to be a British station
named Faraday, and was one of the two stations that found the ozone
&ldquo;hole&rdquo;.  The base is filled with weather and atmosphere
monitoring equipment.  It seemed to be largest station we visited, and
all the walkways were raised.  Didn't take pictures of the inside of the
base, since I was too busy looking at the equipment and trying to figure
it all out.

<h2>Second Landing: Petermann Island</h2>

<p>Weather was slightly disagreeable this time out, a light rain/snow
was falling the whole time.  Made somethings a bit slippery, but was
still fun to get out and see stuff.
  Didn't take that many pictures because of the rain on this landing.

<p>Many of the penguins would &ldquo;swim&rdquo; across the snow fields.
 They did their waddle-walk across the rocks up to the snow.  Then they
would lay down, and use their wings and feet while sliding on their
bellies.  They could move much faster this way.

<p>
Dinner (<small>or supper</small>) tonight was a barbecue.  Which means
of course we ate outside.  There was a strong south wind the whole time,
and that made it really cold.  Everyone was trying to eat with all there
gear on.  It was kind of funny, and would have been funnier if I hadn't
been outside doing the same thing.  The food was good though, as was the
mulled wine.
