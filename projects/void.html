<p>Ages ago, in the basement of an old high school, there was a fervent bunch of coders that should have been working.  Instead they had found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lambdamoo/">LambdaMOO</a>.  There was a great many hours wasted.  Then as it is the wont of startups, things ended and people moved on.  The moo was lost.</p>

<p>It was a time of sadness and despair, although that really had nothing to do with the moo.</p>

<p>Anyhow, in that ancient moo I built up a bit of space and was rather fond of it.  So rather than have it lost, I&#8217;m rebuilding it.  I did try for a bit to restart a moo, but damn, I forgot how much trivial stuff we had built.  Being lazy but not wanting to let this be lost, I dug around for an alternate route to my goal.  Thus I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/">Interactive Fiction</a>.</p>

<p>More importantly, I found compiling tools for it.  The first one I found was <a href="http://tads.org/">TADS</a>, and not being very picky, its the one I am using.  It does what I wanted, and has enough foundation that I&#8217;m not spending time rebuilding little things. (<small>Like chairs.</small>)  Also, it is very nice being able to use revision control on this; something that I had always missed in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lambdamoo/">LambdaMOO</a>.  I&#8217;m using <a href="http://tads.org/download.htm">TADS2</a> because the compiler just worked after I installed it.  <a href="http://tads.org/tads3.htm">TADS3</a> is being a bit of a pain, but I really like the changes they made, so I keep trying to get it to work.  Once it does, I want to port this forward.</p>

<p>Right, so I rebuilt the area that I had in that lost moo. (<small>I still have the notebook where I sketched it out.</small>)  I did rip a bunch of stuff out, mostly trimming everything down to a nice bite-sized project.  Then since this is now a IF game, and not a moo hangout, I twisted a bit of story into it.</p>

<p>You need a game player that supports <a href="http://tads.org/download.htm">TADS2</a> game files.  On Macintosh I use <a href="http://ccxvii.net/spatterlight/">Spatterlight</a>.  For other systems you&#8217;ll need to <a href="http://tads.org/download.htm">find what works</a> for you.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my tiny <a href="archives/TheVoid-0b1.zip">contribution</a>.  Its still beta, but it should all work. Opinions and bug reports <a href="#topdir#/contact.html">welcome</a>.</p>
