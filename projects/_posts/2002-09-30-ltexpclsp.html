    <p>A bit of php3 I wrote to give an outline made from nested &lt;ul&gt;
    lists the ablity to be dynamically expanded or collaped parts. 
    I used it for a while on my bookmark file, but got tired of it.
    Since my web server was fairly weak in cpu, I wrote this specificly to only
    pass over the input data once.  Which is probably it's biggest redeming
    feature.  </p>
