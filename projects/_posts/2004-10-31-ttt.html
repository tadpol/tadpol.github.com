Just poured hot water over a bunch of tea leaves?  Wondering how long to
let is steep?  So did I.  (<small>Actually I usually left it in the
kitchen and forgot about it.</small>)  Until I wrote this little app. 
Launch it, tell it how long to wait, and go.  After the time, it will
alert you that your tea is ready.  Toss the leaves and enjoy.

TTT is built to take advantage of <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>
if you have that installed.  And I really suggest doing that.  Growl is
much nicer than having the dock icon bounce, which TTT can also do.

Alot of hype for a timer? well, yeah. But I wanted to learn Cocoa this
weekend, and I could not think of a project.  Then I went to make some
tea.  After setting it up to steep, I wondered back up to my computer. 
Then it occured to me what I could make, a tea timer app.  Prefect for a
first run.  I begain to program and my tea was forgotten until cold.
(<small>See!? I really do need this.</small>)

Added a spinner so you can tell if the timer is actually running or not.
Also cleaned up the source and put that up.
