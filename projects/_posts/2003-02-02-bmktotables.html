    This was replaced by a XSLT template, so this is no longer maintained.

    I got tired of the way the php3 outline viewer thing for my bookmarks
    page was working, and so decided to work on a replacement.  After toying
    with a handful of different ideas, I decided on something that would
    have an output much like a column browser found in Mac OS X or NeXTStep.
     It is kind of there.  I stopped trying to use a plain old html input,
    and switched to xml with my own special dtd. (<small>well ok, I haven't
    bothered to write the DTD yet...</small>)  To see what kind of output it
    has, hit the Link Farm link below.

    <p>This is written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">ruby</a>, and
    requires 
    <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/cgi-bin/software">rexml</a>. 
    There are a couple of features that I am still wanting to add.  Then
    probably some code clean up, and it should be done then.
