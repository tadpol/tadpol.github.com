This is rit, it is a simple templating engine.  It takes a text file,
and a template file, and produces an output file.  It can be extended
with modules to do more if you feel so inclined.

<p>
I use this script to generate all html files on my web site.  So it
works pretty well.  I have been using it for over a year now too.  I
wrote this because nothing else quite did what I needed, and I was bored.
