While trying to build up the gps-photo-map stuff I did for my [last vacation](#topdir#/vacation/Norway2006/index.html), I ran into the trouble of building a kml file from the photos.  I had already added the gps data to the photos with [GPSPhotoLinker](http://oregonstate.edu/~earlyj/gpsphotolinker/), but now wanted a kml file for [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/).  And ultimately for the map that's on the index page for that trip.

Dug around the net and found a few things, the best of which was still some kind of full package that did uploading of files, which I didn't want.  It was also hard coded for North and West coordinates.  Which complicated its use since my photos where all North and East.

So I wrote my own.  It actually came through pretty easy. Though its not nearly as smooth as others, it builds a fairly lean file that you can edit later. (<small>either by hand or with GEarth.</small>)
