    <p>
    A perl/Tk script that tries to emulate the expander tool in BeOS.
    Basically just a simple front end to the standard tools.
    It is was intended to
    be ran from other interface tools like file managers. (I used it with <a
    href="http://www.kaisersite.de/dfm/">dfm</a>)
    It does not support making or editing archives, only listing the contents
    and extracting them.
