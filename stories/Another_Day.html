<h3>Prelude...</h3>
<p>Just to explain the styling of this one a bit.  First off, I wrote it 
during class, while listening. Which, of course, means I didn't really
give any attention to either, and it shows.  And on the same note, I rather
like the way it turned out; quite dull.  Even though it's supposed to be about
some matrix cowboy; it drones on, like another uneventful day.  Anyways,
enough of this rambling.

<h1>Another Day</h1>

<p>	Knowing the task that he had recently agreed to, he sat down to begin the 
construction of the partial AIs that would do the dirty work.  His hardware
setup had a strange futuristic look to it.  The monitor was a group of flat
screens, arranged so that facing the front center, his entire field of view
had a screen in front of it.  Floating on an adjustable arm, sat a dovark
keyboard with an eraser head joystick next to the 'J' key. Similarly floating
to the right was the ten-keypad, and to the left was the page-keypad.  Finishing
it all off, was a chair that was as equally adjustable.  The whole contraption
being ergonomically perfect to the point of forgetting that were sitting there.
</p>
<p>	The actual computers were unseen, but a dull hum from the nearby closet gave 
way to their hiding place.  Opening the closet quickly reminded one why it 
was in there to begin with.  Looking past the noise, the homemade cluster of
cheap computers and the threading knots of wires lacked the profissionalism
of the main terminal.  But those that could understand the rat's nest of 
equipment, were set back in awe when they figured out the amount computing 
power that was set into this closet.
</p>
<p>	Lightly tapping the space key to wake the terminal, he set up a few 
searchbots to pick out any information about others that may have previously
targeted what he was now after.  With the searchbots off, he began to 
construct a simple AI to scan the parameter of the target to get a better idea 
on how to design the attack AIs.  Having done this enough times before to have 
constructed a massive library of subroutines, he quickly pieced together a 
scout AI.  Then prepped a delivery system to have the scout run its code from 
some other random machine on the net, for only a fool would run something like 
this form their own place.  Letting out a deep sigh, he got up and started to 
make himself a meal.
</p>
<p>	Interrupting his eating with a few beeps, his searchbots proudly showed their
finds onto his display.  After looking over the finds, he began to create 
another scout.  The finds had been sparse, but those that were found contained
wonderful detail.  After finishing and delivering the second scout, he returned
to his now cold meal.  It could be a few days before the scouts returned.
</p>
<p>	Normally he would have a few other runs that he was working on at the same 
time.  One of the few advantages of not being able to do the work himself, was
being able to manage more than one run at a time, the other was being free from
the fear of getting iced.  But not now, runs had been sparse the last few 
months, giving him time to work on other things and worry about money at the 
same time.  After spending a few hours trying to optimize some of the routines
in his AI library, he crashed for the night hopping that the scouts would have
returned by the time he would awake.
</p>
<p>	Crawling out of bed late in the morning, he found that, as he expected, the
scouts were still out.  Knowing this meant he would be sending the attack AI up
against a quite formidable foe, he instinctively set the coffee maker to brew
darker than what he normally pored down his throat.  While surging his body 
with the black liquid, he scanned some the of the usual `hang-outs' to see if 
anyone was asking for his services.  Sighing when he didn't find any, he began
to dress himself for one of the real hang-outs.  Maybe he could find some work
there, hopefully he wouldn't get shot.
