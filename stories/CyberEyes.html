<p> I've always had cybereyes. I can't remember being with out them.  I
don't know why I got them originally, but it was before I could 
remember.  I figure I must have have had bad eyes or something.  But my 
parents got them for me, sorta as a parting gift, then put me up for 
adoption.  Never knew my real parents. </p>

<p> I was adopted by an older couple, they were just becoming 50 year of
age. Never had any kids of their own, I guess they wanted one.  They 
were good parents, treated me fairly.  Didn't spoil me, and didn't over
do it the other way either.  But there was one last standing problem, 
my eyes.  My eyes were silver, shinny silver.  I could always see a 
shiver down my foster mother's back when she looked at me. She hated 
those eyes.  And unlike his wife, my foster dad was completely 
fascinated by them.  He would always ask me what the would looked like 
through my eyes.  I couldn't really tell him, I've never see the world 
in any other way.  Gives me a bit of an advantage to other people with 
cybereyes, they have to adjust to a different way of seeing I'm told.  
Not me, I was still learning how to see when I got new eyes. </p>

<p> I think it was strange that my foster mother never did anything
about  my eyes, I had to have them replaced many times.  Cybereyes don't
grow  with a young boy's body.  Around my tenth birthday, when I was 
scheduled to get new eyes, I talked to my parents in getting a pair 
that looked like real eyes. I wanted them because of the crap I was 
getting from other kids at school. My mom was all over the idea right 
as soon as the doctor told her that you couldn't tell the difference. 
Not only did they look real, but they acted real too.  I got worried 
though, I over heard my foster parents talking about saving to get me 
real eyes. Real as in fleash ones. But they couldn't afford those. I 
thought I was lucky for that. </p>

<p> I didn't want real eyes.  I had become so used to the cybereyes,
that  as far as I considered they were my real eyes. Even if I was 
continually getting them replaced. I had talked to friends, what they 
saw, how they saw. I found out little things about my eyes.  I could 
see farther and clearer than my friends. For them, things got blurry at 
the sides of their vision, for me it was clear. Other little things 
popped up as well. I became clear to me, real eyes would suck. </p>

<p> Not that I needed any more reasons for cybereyes, I started to 
discover add-ons. Night vision, telescoping, thermal vision, and on, 
and on. It excited me. All these amazing things the my eyes were able 
to do with the right add-on, that my friend's eyes would never be able 
to do, that real eyes would never be able to do. </p>

<p> I decided that I was not going to lose my eyes, ever. I worried that
 my foster parents would some day get the money for real eyes. I 
wondered what right they had in giving me different eyes with out my 
permission. I worried that my foster mom might be saving it as a 
surprise. That would be the worst, the ultimate gift in her mind, and I 
would never want it. </p>

<p> I finally asked my foster dad about it. He seemed surprised when I 
asked, although not that much that I asked. He never really answered 
the question, just talked around it until I gave up. </p>

<p> I was just learning to drive then. The next year, my foster mother
became sick. I  don't know what from, they never told me. They ended up
using the money that had been saved for my real eyes to pay for her
stay at the hospital. My foster mother said she was sorry about that
hundreds of times, every time I said how much happier I was for her to
be alive and well. I never said how happy I was that I would get to
keep my eyes. </p>

<!--
<p> All was well, for a while.  A couple years later, my foster mother
was sick again.  Same as last time the doctors said, same as last time
they wouldn't tell me what it was.  Only difference this time was my dad
got it too.  Once again the hospital was eating at my foster parents
funds. </p>

<p> My parents weren't getting better this time, and soon enough, all
that was in my foster parents name was gone.  They actually sent
repersentitives to my college, got me out of a class, and brought me
back to the hospital's offices.  They pollitly explained that my parents
had ran out of money, and that since I was next of kin by law, the bill
would be passed onto me.  The only money I had was what my foster
parents had set aside for my college education.  Good thing that they
put it in my name not theirs.  I told the Hospitial I'd get the money,
and they brought me back to school. </p>

<p> When I got back, I talked to some of my friends about it.  No one
was really sure of what I should do.  The few I showed the bill to said
I should run. It would take most of my life to pay off that bill.  I
didn't like the idea of being forever in debt to the Hospital either.
</p>

<p> I withdrew all that my parents had put away for me, sold some of my
things that I couldn't take with me, and went back to the Hospital. 
When I got there, I discovered that my foster dad had just followed my
mother into a coma.  So much for saying good-bye. </p>

<p> With that all behind me, I left.  I had never been outside of this
city I grew up in, there's a lot of world out there.  I probably won't
see much of it, I can think of worse things.  Like the Hospital finding
me... I need to change my name. </p>
