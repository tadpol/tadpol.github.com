He draws out a long pull of smoke from the paper wrapper placed between
his lips.  Holds it for a moment, and releases the cloud from his lungs.
 In the cool country air, it is hard to tell whether the result is
visible ash or frozen steam.  It matters little to him.  As his cloud
expands to fill the void of the atmosphere, his mind walks inward on the
similarities of this puff of steam or smoke to himself.  Attempting to
fill the void, the cloud dissipates into nothing.
</p><p>
&ldquo;So, is that it?&rdquo; He asks the world around him.  &ldquo;I'm
doomed to destroy myself trying?&rdquo;
</p><p>
He pulls in another lungfull waiting for an answer.  As if God would
somehow decide to speak here and now.  A few attempts at rings occupies
his attention while waiting for the response he knows won't come.
</p><p>
With a deep sigh, he carefully taps the hanging ash from the spent tip
into a small glass jar.  Even though there is no one in sight, he still
would rather not take the risk of getting caught littering a possible
fire.  Not that the damp, freshly cultivated soil of the soy bean field
he stopped by would start up in flames.  But the fines were enough for
the extra caution.
</p><p>
Besides, the collection of ash in the used olive jar had become
something of a trophy.  A simple metric, showing how much he had.  It
was less than half a quarter full.  Filling it was a daunting task, for
these excursions were far and few between.  And ash packs well. 
Nonetheless, the simple pointless goal was some kind of real direction
in his life.  Something he had decided, on his own, for his own. 
Something for him, and that gave it a great deal of value.
</p><p>
A spat of laughter while inhaling drives him to a fit of giggling
coughs.  An image of him fighting to the death for someone trying to
steal the jar of ash.  For sure this had some meaning to him, but not
that much.  All in all, it was just a jar of ash.  And yet he couldn't
deny that it did in fact have value.
</p><p>
With a few more moments, the wrapped release of tension is close enough
to threaten to burn his lips.  Carefully he drops it into the jar.  With
a gentle breath, he keeps the rest burning so there is only ash in the
jar again.  Looking to both the sky and his watch, deciding if there is
time for another.  And while the watch is in agreement, the clouds of
the sky do not seem so.
</p><p>
With a short sigh, he packs his things and self back into the car. 
Knowing that there will be rain on the windshield before he makes it
back home, he hopes that it won't be too heavy.  Thinking that a light
rain might actually extend his state of calmness, his starts his four
hour drive home.  Four hours out, four hours back.  Smoke breaks had
gotten to be quite a bitch once entire cities went smoke free.  But
then, he had to admit, he would have probably never seen the countryside
otherwise.
