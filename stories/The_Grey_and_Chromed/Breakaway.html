    Rain.  Why is it always rain?  Cara did her best to ignore it, though
the autonomic heat regulators in her body were off -- it wouldn't do to be
letting off a column of steam.  No, not tonight.  Years of hidden practice,
training, and augmentation all led down to this.  It had to be perfect.  So
she waited in the cold with nothing but a greasy tarp to cover her, rumpled
folds breaking up her outline as she lay on the roof, waiting for revenge.
</p><p>
    She had learned about the Sentinels when she was five.  The playground
was sparse, that day, little boys and girls playing with new variations on
the oldest toys.  A smiling man in suit and tie, luxurious long coat draped
over one arm, down on his haunches as he talked to her about her digigotchi.
Though the intricacies of quantum-neural gel were lost on her at the time,
she did know her digi was loaded with a Zeira.  Zeira were dumb things, that
spoke mostly nonsense, though they were easy enough to feed and care for --
the perfect first digital pet for a young girl.  She thought it boring,
though she'd never had the heart to erase it and start over.  The man smiled
as she told him all this in her innocent littlegirl way, the oblong
electronic device dangling from one hand and chirruping away.
</p><p>
    How, he asked, would she like a stage II Kenton digi?  He had one, he
said, in the glovebox of his car, that his own little girl had outgrown.
Kentons were the best of the digis.  They could learn english and play games
and everything -- only one digi in maybe twenty grew up to be a Kenton.  She
pouted.  Daddy said never to go off with strangers, she said.  He smiled and
opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out.
</p><p>
    That was when she saw the angel.  His body was the color of brushed
aluminum, with great folding wings tucked closely behind his back.  One hand
was wrapped tightly around the nice man's throat.
</p><p>
    "You shouldn't talk to strangers, Little One," the Angel said, his voice
gruff, "Not everyone is as nice as they act."  Then, to the man, "I need to
talk to you.  Over there."  He gestured, indicating an alley.  The nice man
nodded slightly, making strange noises in his throat.  The Angel strode off,
dragging the nice man with him.
</p><p>
    "I wonder who that was," she said, mostly to herself.
</p><p>
    "Brrrrrochizeeee," the digi chirruped from her hand.  If it had any
further thoughts, it kept them to itself.
</p><p>
    Later, when she told her parents about it, they actually believed her.
Mommy had given Daddy a worried look.  Daddy looked pleased.  "I told you.
I told you he wasn't the Kevorkian type," he said to Mommy, nodding.
</p><p>
    That Christmas she recieved a gift in the mail -- a little enamel
painted pin in the shape of a shield, with a pair of stylized angel wings on
it.  She wore it always.
</p><p>
    Growing up remained suspiciously uneventful, and that young Cara was
never picked on by bullies, or offered drugs of any kind, never struck her
as particularly odd.  She kept company mostly with the overachievers of her
schoolmates, a function of her good grades.  She was one of that strange
group that was driven, seemingly from birth, to succeed.  She thought she
glimpsed her Angel from time to time, though never anything conslusive.  The
whole thing seemed terribly romantic to her.  She thought often of being a
Sentinel herself, one day.
</p><p>
    It would not be until years later that she would think of who her
guardian might be.  It was in the course of doing a middle school paper on
China that she came upon the truth.  She asked her father if great-grandpa
had been involved in the war.  Her father had nodded slowly.  He had.  In
fact, he had been involved at the height of the war, when things had been at
their darkest.  He gave up everything for his country, suffering them to
take his body apart like a machine, slow-growing traces in his mind with
patient nanite laborers.  He lay in a military hospital that was more like a
factory with hundreds of other young men while they worked patiently to
install neuroregulatory systems and the newly invented quantum neural gel
that would run them, into tiny bunkers deep in his brain.
</p><p>
    And when they were done, they had turned him into a tank.  Others became
aircraft, or low-orbit high-mobility recon satellites that could dodge laser
fire, but great-grandpa had become an anti-infantry tank, slung with twin
gatling guns and four independent treads that would allow him to cross
nearly any terrain.  He was gifted with backup systems that kept him alive
even when half a dozen different exoskeletons had been shot out from under
him.  He was an immortal killing machine, responsible for quite possibly
thousands of enemy kills.
</p><p>
    When it was all over, they sent him home in an OD green crate labeled,
"#10632459" only to hook him up to a high capacity network monitor for the
next ten years, maintaining the Army's data security and patiently waiting
for the technology that kept him alive to declassify enough for him to
return to civilian life.
</p><p>
    In a lasting testament to the validity of the Turing Test, it was during
that long stint in the Army that he fell in love, with a young data entry
clerk named Private Margaret Stillman.  He often managed a chat window with
her in his idle moments, savoring her wry sense of humor and the strange,
no-nonsense compassion she exuded.
</p><p>
    When he was finally free of his job with the army, he split 10 years
worth of unspent paychecks between a new cybernetic body for himself, a
house, a ring, and having his original DNA spliced into living sperm.  It
was hardly the stuff of Harlequin romance novels, but it was a beginning.
</p><p>
    And however it had begun, great-grandfather's marriage lasted.  His
enhanced cybernetics and computer interfacing skills made him a highly
sought after quantity in the private sector.  His family grew large as he
and his beloved Margaret grew old, though he had to go in for yearly
cosmetic alterations to keep pace with her.  It foreshadowed a situation too
grim for him to think about seriously, or often.
</p><p>
    His immortality had turned it's ugly side to the light just after Cara
was born.  Her family went to visit them at great-grandfather's behest, only
to find Margaret gently laid out on the bed, having passed peacefully in her
sleep.  Great-grandfather was nowhere to be found, his bank account emptied.
One of Cara's uncles believed he'd gone to find someone capable of ending it
all for him, finally disassembling all the Army had built within his skull,
but Cara's father thought otherwise.  He insisted, loud and often, that
great-grandfather hadn't been "the Kevorkian type".  The old man was just
too damn mean to die, he joked.
</p><p>
    It was a little too close to the truth to be funny.
</p><p>
    Once she knew the truth, Cara's attitude about her Sentinel soured.
This was no Angel from above.  After a certain age being stalked, no matter
how benign the stalker, no longer holds any appeal.  Towards the end of high
school she found herself seeking trouble, though it somehow always evaded
her.
</p><p>
    By the time she escaped to college, as far from home as she could get,
Cara had matured into a fierce woman, always pushing, always testing.  She
changed her name, changed her appearance, changed her style.  Anything to
get away.  And it seemed to have worked.  After a few scary near-misses,
including a mugging outside a nightclub, she knew she had made it.  She had
broken away.  She was finally free, even if freedom meant failure.
</p><p>
    And with her new freedom, she settled down.  Got back to her studies,
slowly but surely reconquered her abandoned life.  She even fell in love
with a fellow student at university -- John.  His quick smile and quiet
confidence made her feel at home for the first time in years.
</p><p>
    Under the tarp, in the rain, she shook her head, forcing herself to
focus on the task at hand.  Now she was the protector.  She was the
Sentinel.  She put her eye to the high power scope of her .50 BMG rifle,
awaiting her target.  He would have to stop by his rooftop eyrie to recharge
soon, the last couple days of rainy weather making solar power problematic.
She'd done her best to manipulate him, keeping his attention below the cloud
layer so he couldn't recharge.  Her patience would soon pay off.  She
thought of what had happened to John, her jaw clenching.
</p><p>
    The target landed on the roof of the building.  She thumbed on the fuzzy
logic system in the scope and waited for it to make a recommendation based
upon the distance and wind speed.  John had just been what his friends
called him, of course -- she thumbed off the safety and took up the slack
first stage of the trigger -- most people had trouble pronouncing Guangxing,
after all.  So he always said, "I'm Guangxing Li -- just call me John" with
that sudden smile of his.  Inside the scope a red dot appeared a foot above
the Angel's shoulder -- where to aim if she wanted to hit his head.  Poor
John --the police had found him just after her Sentinel had, his head
crushed, the words, "DIE CHINK DIE" carved on his chest in crude block
letters.  The odd footprints leading away from the body stopped in the
middle of a field, as if the assailant had suddenly taken to the air.  She
remembered standing over the coroner's table in shock, John's ring on her
finger and his baby just beginning to grow in her belly.  What lengths would
her Angel go to protect his bloodline?  What lengths would *she* go to?
</p><p>
    The BMG went off with a sound reminiscent of worlds colliding.  She
chambered another round, though there was no need, and watched
dispassionately as the chrome angel fell first to it's knees, then forward
onto its chest.  As she let out a shuddering sigh, she realized it was all
over.  A surprising sense of emptiness came over her.  What next?
</p><p>
    She knew, somewhere out in the world her son was living, just barely old
enough to be on his own, really -- raised in secret, on the run, she hadn't
been able to give him much.  She could go to protect him.  She could, but
would not; she loved him enough to let him make his own mistakes.
