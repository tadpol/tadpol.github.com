I'd got lucky. She was one of the nice ones.
</p><p>
"Would you like a cup of tea,dear?". I nodded. The old woman walked into the
kitchen, and began the ancient ritual involving luke-warm water, bovine
nutrients intended for young animals and the leaves of a plant not even
native to this island. I sighed. I was more of a coffee girl myself. Oh
well, if it kept the old dear happy, then who am I to rain on her barbecue?
"Five sugars and lots of milk, please" I sung out as the inevitable question
was asked. I've always had a sweet tooth, and everyone keeps telling me I'll
have to wear dentures by the time I'm thirty. But after this job, I'd be
able to get those fancy genetic croc treatments, and grown my own
indefinetly. I looked around at the old woman's house. It was one of those
that was almost tasteful, if you like all that oldy-worldy junk.
Carpeted floor, with some sort of static pattern. Static walls too. A dark,
comfortable sofa, and a few chairs around a coffee table that was _so_ 2010.
Hah! And she brings me tea!.A modern rented entertainment station stood
anacronistically within the old fireplace. The old don't seem to have ever
got their heads around the fact that you can have mobile, virtual and
wearable displays. Perhaps they just don't like them. Personally, I never
went out without some good anime showing on my jacket.
</p><p>
Here she is now, waddling back from the kitchen to the postition I have
taken on the sofa. She smiles at me, but it's the grotesque smile of age. I
smile back, and reach for the pink wafers piled high on the plate. That's at
least a couple more cavities worth, but I don't care now. I'm going in for
the kill.
</p><p>
"So, young woman, which organisation do you work for again?"
I smile. "I'm a worker for the local arm of the Global Aged Alliance. I'm
sure you've heard of us. We are a union of mature, responsible citizens, who
wish to ensure that the growing majority of people who fall within our age
range. We pride ourselves on fighting for the rights of the over eighties"
She looks pleased as I say this, wriggling and shifting her bulk in the
oversize chair, so that it squeaks.
"Well, dear, I hope I qualify. I'll let you into a little secret. I'm over
one-hundred and twenty years old!"
This is almost too easy. "Really? I'd guess you weren't a day over
one-hundred!". I'm a good liar. Especially to these oldies.
She chuckles to herself. A grotesque sound. "And am I correct in thinking
you want me to join the GAA? To contribute my opinions and experience did
you say?"
</p><p>
"That's correct. We've had a computer running a pre-cognitive program for
over a week, and it indicated that you would be the best candidate for the
job, Mrs Williams". I look up into her glowing eyes, and keeping contact,
make sure I hammer my point home. "And of course, that would mean that you
would be working again......"
</p><p>
The eyes flash when I say that. The one thing oldies desire more than their
youth, is a job. A chance to be useful again. ".........so if you'd just
sign this document here, here and here. Oh, and write your national
insurance number in the box.". She grabs for the contract, almost ripping it
in the process. Heaven help that it should get away. She signs it without
even reading it. I gently prise it from her claws and put it in my bag. As
soon as it's safely stored, the doorbell rings.
</p><p>
"That's my associate, Mr Pinch". I start to slowly move away from the front
door. "He's come to pick us up and take us to headquarters.". The old lady
creaks to her feet, and moves towards the door. I'm still too close, but
there's nothing much I can do about that now. As she turns the handle, I
dive for cover.
</p><p>
The taser barbs punch throught the door, and embed themselves in the old
woman's neck. Fourty thousand volts flow through the wires in a sudden flash
of deadly current. She jerks like a fish on a line, out of control. Those
horriffic eyes glow an even brighter red , and a scream of pure agony leaves
her mouth. I'm hiding behind the chair and already I know that somethings
gone wrong. The old lady doesn't drop like she's supposed to, and instead
rips the door off the hinges with inhuman strength. Pinch is revealed,
standing behind with a look that says his life has already flashed before
his eyes, and he's just waiting for the credits. Shit!  I fish the demo
charge out of my smart businesswoman handbag, and pull the priming
mechanism. Somehow Pinch manages to dodge the first swipe of Mrs Williams
cyberarm, and then I'm within range. Just as I'm about to plant the
explosive on her exposed back, she whirls around. She's probably got the
latest sensory equipment in that grotesque plastic skull, but she's still
not used to the sheer speed of the augmentations. Her metal hand misses my
skull by at least a good centimeter, and as I slap the magnetic limpet onto
her temple, the irises of her photoelectirc eyes grow wide with terror.
She's clawing at the explosive now, pulling with both enchanced arms, but
the in-built inductive electromagnet can suck as much energy from her system
as it ever needs.</p><p>
I turn and dive behind the steel-reinforced chair.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I hear Pinch's voice. "Carrie, are okay?!. Ohshitohshitohsit! I knew we
shouldn't have done this. You're dead and it's all my fault!!!".
Typical Pinch. Melodramatic and impractical. He hasn't even checked my
pulse.</p><p>
I sit up and groan, and make my own assesment. I've got a superfical cut on
my forehead, and my torso feels like I've got bruises that'll take a month
to heal, but I'm not dead yet.  I stand up.
"Pinch.......Pinch!.....PINCH!". He turns back around. Instantly I'm
smothered in that warm-Pinch smell, and I yet out a yell as he squashed my
already abused ribcage.</p><p>
"I'm okay. Look at me.".  Powder blue eyes look into mine, and we kiss.
Twenty seconds of exchanged saliva later, Pinch's hands start wandering
inside my expensive, ripped blouse. Action always makes Pinch horny. I pull
away, and give him a quick peck on the cheek. "Darling Pinch, can we wait
until we've finished the job please?".</p><p>
I turn back to the late Mrs Williams. The explosion had destroyed most of
her head, leaving only a metal and plastic stump poking out of a floral
print dress. With the sensory augments gone, it looked like I wouldn't get
those crocodile teeth anytime soon.. At least she was one of those oldies
who got regularly upgraded. The limbs and organs should fetch a good price
on the market.  Pinch dissapears outside, to bring the van with the lifting
crane on around the back. I pick a pink wafer from the floor, and munch
thoughtfully.  The contract gave us full disposal rights for the body, and
if the worst came to the worse, we knew a few places where we could unload
the odd artificial organ. Standing there, I looked down at the remains of
something that had once been a human being, it's organs replaced one by one
as they failed with age. Sometimes I think what we do is a service to
humanity.
