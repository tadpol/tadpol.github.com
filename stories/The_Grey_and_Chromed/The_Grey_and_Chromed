Since Charleson Mambo missed a story on his server I thought I'd post a
list of all the stories in the order they hit my server - I'm cross
referencing this with Google to make sure I don't miss any, let me know if
I do though. I know there have been several cooperatively shared
story-arcs lately that have been inspired off of each other but this just
concerns us with the ones about the old folks... I can put together
similar posts/lists of the other shared story-worlds if people want.

The Grey And Chromed:

Brain Trust pt. 1 - Mr. ? - August 1
Brain Trust pt. 2 - Mr. ? - August 4
Respect Your Elders - Dan Argent - August 22
Sentinals - Mr. ? - August 25
Angels - ghost - August 29
Demons - sicarius - August 29
The Gaurdians - Mr. ? - August 30
Concerns - tadpol - August 30
Breakaway - rune - August 31
Choices - ghost - August 31

As you can see there is quite a bit of lag from the very first to the next
segment (18 days) and then it shortens up a bit for the two after that (3
and 4 days) and then we kick into overdrive and go psycho with mere hours
between the next 5 sections (an average of 12 hours between pieces from
Angels up to Choices). Sno-ball effect. We obviously feed off of each
others imaginations... this is a good thing.

[btw: Dan Argent is to blame for the very soap opera sounding subject line
of this post and it's definately an interesting title for the whole
story-arc]
