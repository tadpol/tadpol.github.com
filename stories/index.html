<p>
Here is a collection of things that have entered my mind that are not in
the languages of machines.  Some of these pieces come from things that
have happened.  Some touch to people and events that may or may not
happen, or exist.  Some might in the future, some might have in the
past, and some may now.  These kinds of things happen.  Don't take it
too seriously, you might insult my characters.

These are fragments of larger stories, and such they don't often make much sense on their own.
(<small>I may someday rework things here to include those other parts. (<small>The ones I have anyways.</small>)</small>)
