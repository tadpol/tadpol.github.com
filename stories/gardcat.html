	<p>My attention snaps me awake as I hear the door open.  Two guys
quietly enter the apartment.  [Bad sign I think.]  I reach over and pick
up my claws, and strap them onto my hands.  Carefully touching each of
the claws making sure that they're still sharp, I watch the men, from my
dark corner, walk towards the bed across the room as if they're been
here before.  As they aproch, she begins to wake, turning on the dim
reading light by her bed.</p>
	<p>"Eddie?" she sleeply asks, "How'd you get in here?"</p>
	<p>With out responding to her question, he grabs her and starts to
bind her. [Eddie? Hmmm, must be someone she knows from the bar.]</p>
	<p>"She is good", says the other, "She will bring a good price."</p>
	<p>[The other must be some sort of slaver.]  I let out a small growl
to draw some attention.  The both look right to where I'm crouched
without seeing me. [They don't have enhanced vision, good, that will
make this easier.]</p>
	<p>"What was that?", the slaver asks her.</p>
	<p>She chokes out, "My cat." through the gag that was loosened for
her reply.</p>
	<p>[Cat? Well, I suppose that is one way of describing me.]</p>
	<p>"Kill it," He tells Eddie.</p>
	<p>Eddie begins to walk towards my corner, gentelly cooing "Here
kitty, kitty."  I wait until he's just about on top of me.  Just as he
get close enough to make out my shape, I quickly snap into motion; with
a small flick from my wrist, I draw my claws across his chest.  I feel
the blades of each claw tug a little as they move through his ribs. 
[I'm going to have these sharpened, they seem a bit dull.]  His body
stops with out a sound.</p>
	<p>"What is it?", the slaver asks, becoming a bit worried when he
doesn't receive an answer.  He draws his gun an cautiously moves towards
the corner.  I push Eddie slightly to make him fall backwards.</p>
	<p>As soon as he sees the blood on the Eddie's chest he fires off a
couple rounds.  [Very quiet, must be silenced.]  I hear the bullets hit
the wall above me.  Taking the dead man's gun, I return two shots to the
slaver.  First bullet into his chest; second into his head.
[Clumsy, I missed the first shot.] Everything becomes still for a
moment.</p>
	<p>"It's a good thing you can see in the dark," she comments through
the still loosened gag.  I can hear her voice waver as she tries not to
sound shaken up.</p>
	<p>Saying nothing, I walk into the dim light to unbind her.  The
reading light by her bed casts my shadow onto a near wall.  Human
shaped, with cat ears and a tail.  [So, when did I become <i>your
cat</i>?]</p>
