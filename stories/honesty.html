"Ah, hello. you're awake.  heh, I'd ask if you were well, but, ah, you're
quite still hooked to all of this life support stuff.  Feel any pain? no,
that's good.  Umm, gee, where to start.  Who am I? umm, well. I suppose you
may remember seeing me once in a while.  I did show up now and then.  But
for the most part I've been just watching...Well, no.  Not spying on you or
stalking or anything like that.  Just checking once and a while to see that
you were doing ok.  Umm, yeah, who am I.  well, umm, I'm your
great-grandfather.
</p><p>
"I imagine its kinda hard to believe, I certainly don't look it.  I mean
here is a man that looks about your age, telling you he's your
great-grandfather.  Heh, it has to be a bit odd.  Probably thinking I'm
trying to con you into something.  Ah well no.  I've got one question.  But
first I am going to try and describe who, and what I am.
</p><p>
"As I already said.  I am you great-grandfather.  With the war present, and
just the basic need to be ahead of the game in the work force, I saved and
took some modifications.  Cybernetic stuff.  And well, its got a bit of a
power kick.  All of a sudden being really good at something.  So I, ah,
saved and got more.  And well, over time enough got replaced that age
stopped being an issue.  Umm, that would have been a couple of years after
your grandmother was born.  She wasn't all that keen on what her father was
doing, but she never said much, aloud.  You grandmother was a great
daughter.  You would have loved to meet her.  And....I'm rambling.
</p><p>
"Yeah, anyways.  So I stopped aging.  And well, that kinda made things
difficult.  I wasn't, am not, the type to kill myself, so ah, I kept
living.  And well, lots of things, umm, people are not to keen on the idea
of someone over a hundred being around.  And I learned to just not tell
people how old I was, but it didn't help much.  All jobs require SINs and
well, once they had that, they knew how old you were.  And so it got to the
point where I couldn't work any more just because I was too old.
</p><p>
"I certainly didn't look it.  I've pretty much kept this near thirty look.
It, ah, suits me I think.  I've added a lot of other neat things.  Memory
enhancements and some other things.  Not having work wasn't too bad.  I was
good at saving what I earned, and that had grown to a nice sizable sum.
And the financial institution I had most of my money in didn't seem to mind
my age.  And well, it was actually them that connected me with others.
That was nice, discovering that there were others in my position.
</p><p>
"Well, it was about it this time that your father got hurt in a random
mugging.  That rightly pissed me off.  And after leaving a fraction of my
savings with the hospital to pay the bill, I went after the muggers.  I am
still not sure why I did that.  I was just so mad that my family was
attacked, I had to retaliate.  Well, I woke the next morning in another
hospital.  I had dragged myself there, and previous to this I never had any
real fighting modifications.  Umm, this is when I met Jesse.  Well,
actually I met her before, I just didn't realize her age.  Uh, she is like
me, sorta ageless.
</p><p>
"That'd be when I decided to just kinda watch over my family.  Protect
them as best I can.  I didn't need to work, the interest off my savings was
more than enough, even after joining the Foundation.  With your siblings
and cousins scattered over the globe its been a real trick I tell you.
umm. yeah. well. yeah. I hope what I've done isn't ill taken.
</p><p>
"umm. sorry if it is.
</p><p>
"...
</p><p>
"Umm, anyways, the question.  Umm. well.  You've got a lot of the traits I have.
And well, I didn't want to ask you this for another couple of decades.  But
well, I guess, ah, circumstances change things.  Anyways, the question.  I
did ask your father this.  he said no.  And it is perfectly ok if you also
say no.  or wait.  I think it would be ok if you wanted to wait.  But,
yeah, the question.  umm, Do you want to be a Sentinel?  Like me.  Not
aging, and protecting you family and stuff.  Its actually kinda fun
sometimes.  And the heath care is really good. heh. umm. yeah. not funny."

A creak of the door, Shane walks in. "Samatha is awake now Richard." he
states, "So if you're done practicing, you can try talking to her for real
this time."
</p><p>
A deep nervous sigh. "yeah. might as well.  I am as ready as I will ever
be." Richard says, standing, wiping his hands on his pants. "...ready as
I'll ever be..." he says again to himself, following Shane to Samatha's
room.
