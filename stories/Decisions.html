Jesse sat down across from Richard, placing the old manilla envelope
in her lap. "I know you went over this with Shane." She started. "But
just putting her back isn't going to help any. Her life is already
destroyed, you're in to deep to back out now." She looked at him on
the couch across from her. "She might try to find out what really
happened. She might succeed."
</p><p>
Richard look up, he had been hunched over, wringing his hands.  That
position that people seemed to always have in waiting rooms.  Something
deeply engrained.  He looks up at Jesse, eyes reflecting every light in the
room.  Having been coated with a lite layer of tears, they gave mirrored
hints to the metals embedded below.  As the words sink in, fires seem to be
lit behind the watery fronts.
</p><p>
Steeling himself, getting his mind ready, Jesse was a hard woman to
disagree with.  He had worked hard so that Samatha would have a normal
life.  A life without any of the necessary evils that had dominated his.
This wasn't going to change because of a car accident.  With a single deep
breath; looks Jesse right in the eyes, "No."
</p><p>
"Why not? She's here. She's ready. Her life is already in shambles,
at least let me put it back and give it purpose." She undid the
string holding the envelope in her lap closed and pulled out a single
sheet of paper. "Last week an Angel was killed. Cause of death was
severe head trauma in the form of a fast moving large calibur round.
His own great-granddaughter shot him." She put the paper down and
looked Richard in the eye, "Do you know why? Because he wanted to
give her a protected life free from all the evils we faced. Because
his own prejudice wouldn't let her make her own choices." She put the
sheet back and place the file next to her on the couch. "The GAA has
taken the offensive again. the Angels took out seven cities in one
night. It won't go without retaliation. What if the GAA get you?
who's next in line?" She leaned forward, her eyes still locked to
his, "What if Samatha has to find out on her own what happened and
comes after you?"
</p><p>
He stairs back for a moment silently, hoping she will look away.  Knowing
she won't, and looks away.  Looks anywhere but in Jesse's eyes.  Grinding
his teeth, muscles tensing, he's losing this argument already, and it
hasn't even started.
</p><p>
He had noticed various traits in Samatha.  Those particular traits that
were shared by most who where Sentinels.  Determination, confidence,
loyalty to family, and others.  She was right, Samatha would figure out
what happened, if she searched.  And he had fancied the idea of asking her
about her future, but not for another decade, at least, maybe two.  He
wanted her to have her own family first, before knowing.  And he wanted it
to be an option, something she could think about.  Not something that would
have to be explained afterwards.
</p><p>
Calming himself, trying to hide his frustration with a situation he could
not control, he blatantly changes the subject.  "An Angel was killed?"
</p><p>
Jesse stands up, grabbing the file, "Let's finish this over some
breakfast, I haven't eaten much today." She took a few steps, "On
me." Not that it mattered who bought, it was the gesture. Richard was
anything but relaxed, she needed him calm and open. They were silent
as the walked to the car. Jesse simply tossed the file in the
back seat of her old porche and drove off.
</p><p>
She knew Richard was fighting himself more than her. She could see it
in his eyes, his movements. "He was in the Chinese War, turned into
one of those awful war machines. Nothing but a mind engineered to
destroy. Her boyfriend was Chinese." She was talking now, just to
break the silence of Richard brooding in her passenger seat. "He
killed the man dead in cold blood. Because he didn't approve of one
of his, one of his favorite, being with them. With his enemy. They're
not our lives to live, not our choices to make." She was almost glad
the Angel was dead, almost. "So who was the bomb for, you, him or
her? maybe all three? Who ordered it? Why do I have to be the one to
put everything back together again and pretend I never saw it
happen?" She wasn't sure who she was talking to anymore, Richard,
herself, the steering wheel maybe.
</p><p>
"Me, I think", he answers while staring at the passing scenery, "Much more
fire power used than needed for regular humans."  While idlely playing with
the seat beat, he adds, "I contacted Christof.  Gave him a full dump from
my tactical computer.  He should have some leads soon."  He leaves the last
question hang.  Jesse had put him and many other Sentinels back together
many, many times.  There was a fair amount of them that would have passed
on long ago with out her.  And he just wasn't sure how to answer it.
</p><p>
She pulled into the parking lot and got out, "You know I'm right. You
know it's the best choice now."
</p><p>
Climbing out of the car, still avoiding directing looking at Jesse, he
looks up at the Restaurant.  A moment; inner machinery loads up a set of
memories.  Letting out a small sigh, he realizes how distracted his is.  Of
course Jesse would pick this place.  Somewhere he'd been often enough that
even without enhanced memory, he knew the entire menu.  He had spent a lot
of time here once.  No one there would know him now, but that was
irrelevant.  This place held enough good memories, that even the shortest
trip through memory lane would put him in a good mood.  Another soft sigh,
"I should venture the guess that they still use real eggs if you ask?"
</p><p>
"Of course." She walked inside, Richard close behind. She knew the
effect the place would have on him, relax him a little.
</p><p>
They sat eating breakfast, silent as they ordered food and waited.
Once the food arrived Jesse didn't say anything for a few minutes.
Waiting for Richard to fully relax and get over just coming from a
hospital. "We have a lot to do." she said between bites of real eggs,
the yolks runny. "Somewhere out there are a lot of people who want to
get rid of us. The GAA for one, another unnamed group that may be
related that seem to be targeting the youth of today - our own.
Ourselves now as well. Paul was killed on purpose by someone who has
access to almost as much firepower as us. Some of the Angels want
revenge. The Mists are probably off not paying attention - or not
acting on anything yet. We need to solidify ourselves. the Foundation
isn't cutting it anymore. We need something new." She stopped and
looked across at him.
</p><p>
"I let Clarisse in on my little secret. She's twenty-five. The
youngest of all my great-grandchildren, under ideal circumstance I
would have waited another three decades. I don't believe we have the
luxury of waiting that long. It will be to little to late if we did."
She looked out the window, "If we don't do this now, when do we do
it? After the GAA has come for us? After we schism as our ideals stay
inert and time moves on?" Jesse let out a deep breath.
</p><p>
"When I was forty I was set in my ways. I'd spent to many years doing
the same thing over and over. When I was seventy I didn't know how to
change my pattern and was still stuck, wishing for those good old
days. When I was one hundred I finally worked up the courage to
change my routine and become someone other than who I was. I'd
changed how I looked at the world, it all became a full of
opportunities again. I started this when I was nineteen. Why do we
all wait until our Chosen are in their fifties to ask them to change?
We want them to live their lives out, what was so wrong about the
life we lived that they can't have it?" She turned and locked eyes
with Richard. "Stop avoiding the subject and tell me once and for all
what it's going to be. Do we pretend nothing happened and carry on,
or do we change the future and stop it from happening again?"
</p><p>
Richard looks away from Jesse, out the window.  Sees people walking, driving,
oblivious.  A small stream of jealousy for the people living a life he
wishes he had. Looking back to Jesse, "You're not going to let me choose
this any other way."  His face hardening with determination, "It has to be
her decision.  I have to ask her, give her the chance to say no.  And her
decision will be final."  Richard doubted Samatha would deny this
opportunity.  But as her decision, his conscious would be clear.
</p><p> 
"That's what I wanted to hear." Jesse smiled warmly, "I'll take you 
back to the hospital, she should be well enough to talk soon." She 
got up, paid the bill and they driving back to the hospital. She 
stopped in front of it, "If she says yes I'll do any augmentation 
sugery myself. There are some apartments in the sub-basement you can 
get some rest in, Shane will show you." She watched Richard get out, 
"I have some other business to try and take care of now." She watched 
him walk inside and drove off. She opened a line and dialed, "Susie, 
it's Jesse. I need someone found..."
