<p>
Rain, rain please don't go away<br>
please don't wait until another day.<br>
Flashes of light<br>
to my hearts delight<br>
Boom of thunder<br>
soon a full storm to blow us under<br>
clear my mind, washing it free<br>
memories unwanted are haunting me<br>
My true nature forms in the sky<br>
worrying all of the passers by<br>
they do not understand the beauty I see<br>
when the rain storm washes over me.<br>
sheets of rain, blow wind blow.<br>
only you can know what my heart knows<br>
she did not leave me, I sent her away<br>
for what reasons I can not say<br>
but at times she is in my mind<br>
twist and bind, until I find<br>
Rain Rain please come and stay<br>
and wash these memories away.<br>
</p>
