Mosaic of Me

Having some fun here.  There's been a <a href="http://www.librarything.com/blog/2007/01/you-are-what-you-read.php">couple</a> <a href="http://www.librarything.com/blog/2007/02/more-mosaics_03.php">posts</a> on the <a href="http://www.librarything.com/blog/index.php">LibraryThing</a> blog about making mosaics of yourself from the covers of the books you own.  So I figured why not:



<a href="/images/mosaic_me_big.jpg"><img src="/images/mosaic_me.jpg" /></a> <br /> (<small>Click through the image to get a zoomed in version.</small>)



Its a tad blurry, and poking around a bit, I get the distinct feeling that it would be clearer if I had more book covers.  Given there are 1600 images in the mosaic, and I've only about 400 books.  Ah well, guess I need to go buy more books, darn. `^_^`
