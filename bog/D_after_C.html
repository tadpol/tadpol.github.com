<p>After finding the <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/">language D</a> about a year ago, I&#8217;ve finally got around to playing with it.  Mostly, this delay was due to not having a compiler for my mac.  Until I found <a href="http://gdcmac.sourceforge.net/">binary packages</a> for the gcc front end.  Nice and spiffy.</p>

<p>D is a pretty nice language, what I&#8217;ve played with so far anyways.  They seem to be doing a nice job of pulling many modern language features, while maintaining native compilation <b>and</b> static typing.  Pretty neat combination, I think.</p>

<p>The native compilation is nice to see.  For my own personal playing, and tweaking of my systems, having a VM with piles of support libraries isn&#8217;t an issue.  But when I start to think about packaging, and distributing, and supporting something I&#8217;ve built, perspective changes.  In addition to all of the (<small>unfortunately</small>) common problems of application interactions, you now get to track the VM as well.  When installing your applications onto a costumer&#8217;s platform, do you hope there is a compatible VM? Or do you ask your users to install a certain one? Or put one &#8216;inside&#8217; your application?  Now when users install multiple applications from multiple vendors, how does all of this interact?  And so on and so forth.</p>

<p>It just simplifies customer support interactions a bit by taking the VM out.  There is a lot of stuff like that in D.  There seems to be a large focus on doing what software developers need.  Based on what they are actually doing, not on what some theories about software design suggest.</p>

<p>The static typing thing I find rather amazing.  Just me I know, but after using C and playing with C++, then finding <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/">Io</a>.  I was totally in the mind set that static typing was wrong and evil.  Well, surprise surprise, you can have static typing and not have it get in the way. (<small>without just casting everything to void* too.</small>)  So, I think that&#8217;s pretty neat.</p>

<p>I was hoping to have a <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/articles/bbedit/codeless_language_module.html">BBEdit Codeless Language Module</a> for D to go with this post.  But D is proving to be way to complex to get anything useful from a Codeless Language Module.  So I&#8217;ve stopped messing with that.  Looked into trying a coded language module, but that&#8217;s gonna take more time and energy than I&#8217;ve got to spare.  oh well.</p>
