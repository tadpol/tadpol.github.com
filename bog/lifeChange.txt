People say it many times, but it is meaningless until it happens to you.  Having a baby changes everything.  There are a fair amount of things I want to do, and posting updates to this site falls to the bottom.  There is a redesign pending because of this, but I'm busy on other things.  Basically, moving away from the blog style to something I used way back when.

There, changed.
