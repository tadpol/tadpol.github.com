#tagline It is not as if I don't have enough reasons to buy {LEGO}s already, but {designing my own}? Am so there.



While poking around looking for ideas to mess with my [NXT][], I happened across [LEGO Digital Designer][LDD].  I had heard of it before, but never really thought much of it.  Not having much else I wanted to do, I downloaded it.  Figuring that I would at least use up a couple hours trying to model some [NXT][] sets.  And so I played, and it was fun.



I should mention here that I also follow [Brothers Brick][BroBrick], and the posts about [mini-spaceships](http://www.brothers-brick.com/2007/12/14/rainbow-warriors/) always caught my eye.  This naturally came to mind while I was playing with [LDD][].  So I gave a go at building some. Pretty easy in [LDD][].  There had been a handful of warnings here and there about part selection that I was, up until this point, happily ignoring.



There is this little icon on the tool bar, of a brick and a globe and an arrow connecting the two.  I was curious.  I am really trying to imagine how I was supposed to say no when I got bounced to a web page asking if I would like to buy the set I just designed.  I mean really.  Design my own set and get the parts for it without having to scrounge them from other sets? Totally must do, totally.



So I did.



And here it is, unopened:<br/>
