<p>wheee! Back from two trips out to the 
<a href="http://www.bwcaw.org/">Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness
(BWCAW)</a>. Great fun I say.  Not too bad gear wise, and a bit
disorganised on the second, but over all was still great fun.  Made my
list for next time too. (<small>Bring extra snacks.  Yes, you really
need rain pants.  Always pack extra snacks, even if you helped buy the
food.  A sleeping pad that packs smaller would be really nice.  Did I
mention extra snacks?</small>)
</p>
<p>I don't bring a camera on these trips, but others did.  I'll have to
see if I can get some of the pictures.  I did bring a GPS unit this
year.  Was fun in its own way.  Being concerned about the batteries
dieing, I kept it off most of the time.  Typically only turning it on to
mark a waypoint.  Which I did for portages and camp sites.  I also
grabed a few spots where we stopped for lunch that wasn't a camp site. 
And a few other features. (<small>I marked one bearver dam, don't remember 
why though.</small>)
</p>
<p>All though this I was hoping that I would be able to take the way
points, and then get some program that would show them on a map.  I
looked but couldn't find any free programs that did that.  I think I
found a couple pakages I could buy, but all of them made it clear that
you couldn't redistirbute the maps they showed.  And that is exactly
what I want to do.  Too bad.  I did save the waypoint data though.  So
here it is for the <a href="BWCAW2004-1.zip">first</a> and
<a href="BWCAW2004-2.zip">second</a> trips.  I really had
wanted to be able to show topo maps here. Oh well. (<small>I'm gonna
keep looking for something that will at least make a vector image of the
waypoints.</small>)
</p>
<p>
I would probably be excited about doing this again next year if I wasn't 
going hiking and camping in Alaska next month.</p>

<h3>[Update: Fri May 27 18:06:59 CDT 2005]</h3>
<p>Spiffy! I found a <a href="http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/">web
site</a> that will take GPS data and make little maps! So I went and did
that quick.  <b>sigh</b> Now I really wish I had kept tracks instead of
just making a few waypoints.  Oh well, Next year.</p>
