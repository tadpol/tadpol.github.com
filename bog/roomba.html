I was doing ok, really.  Looking at the various models, comparing specs
and the like.  Then I saw it, and I knew.  This was how I would vacuum. 
It was the only way.  <a href="http://www.irobot.com/consumer/">Roomba</a>.
Right there on the self.  I resisted at first.  I mean really, how good
was it really? Never mind the stairs.  I reasoned with myself, wondering
aimlessly around the store for a good thirty or more minutes.  Finally,
I figured I'd run home quick, read some reviews, convince myself it
wasn't really what I needed, and get a real vacuum.
</p>
<p>
So I ran home quick.  I looked up reviews.  And some more reviews.  And
looked at a few more just in case.  Then b-lined to the store.  I must
have it. It was by no means perfect.  But it did as good as any other it
seemed, minus the stairs.
</p>
<p>
So I have a Roomba.  Yeah, never mind the stairs.  I'll think of
something, really.  Later.  In the mean time, it is bumping about my
bedroom, pulling up most everything.  Watching it for a bit, you can see
that it is a little bit more than just bump-n-go, a little bit less than
building full internal maps.  All of it is just plain neatness.
</p>
<p>
I am such a geek.
</p>
<p>
I wonder how I'm gonna vacuum the stairs...
