The more a fledgling company becomes a real company, the more PC they
get.  There are some good things about this, but there are also a lot of
little things that just down right suck.  And without question, the most
irritating thing of all, is slowly learning just how low other people's
tolerances can really be.

So here is a little bit of fun that is no longer safe for the internal,
corporate web site.  But this being a personal site, is perfectly fair
game.
