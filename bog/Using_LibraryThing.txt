Using LibraryThing

I've been messing around with the front page of my site some more.  Got things worked out so that the latest entry shows up there, but there are a few other things I had wanted to get as well.  One of which was a random sample of the books I own.  I tried building a few systems myself, but they never quick worked out they way I wanted.  Then somewhere in there I stumbled onto <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a>.

It has turned out to be quite nice.  Though I really do wish they had some kind of API for imports and edits.  Since I've all my book in a <a href="http://books.aetherial.net/wordpress/">catalog program</a> on my desktop already, and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">LT</a> pretty much just does ISBN mass imports, having to go back and tweak all the entries is rather a pain.  I'd much rather be building something to link the two.  Oh well.
