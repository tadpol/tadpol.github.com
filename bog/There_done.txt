There, done.

Hurrah. The latest mutation of my website rendering code is complete.  Much cleaner code. (<small>well, any thing rewritten will be cleaner than two years of accumulated kludging.</small>)  That and actually figuring out how to use xml:base in the feed got rid of a huge pile of URL re-mangling code.  That bit of code was prone to some serious weird-isms; I'm glad to be rid of it.

I also took the chance to switch all pages into UTF8.  Not that this really changed anything for most of them, but it seemed like a good things to do.  Then, I took the plunge and switched to Atom from RSS.  That was a pain in the posterior.  Atom is freakish strict compared to RSS.  There are still a few violations, but they're from old pages that use named entities.  Maybe I'll go clean those up some later date; maybe not.

The hardest part of a change like this is making sure it worked everywhere.  I think I got it, but its hard to tell.  Something always seems to slip through.  Oh well, I'll deal with that when I find it.

Of course, after having done all this, I no longer remember what it was that I had originally tired to do.  Whichever, it is done now, so I can go play with other things.
