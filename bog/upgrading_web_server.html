<p>I only really had three requirements for this, all pretty fair for the way I will use this machine.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Quiet, fanless if possible.</li>
<li>Performance, basically >=1GHz, >=512MB ram</li>
<li>Price, as close to $400 as i can get.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, the quiet bit really takes us out of the true server class of machines.  No worries there, just look at what I consider to be performance.  So my current thing is, why is this so hard to find?  </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found plenty of sites that build quiet machines, but the only way to get them under $600, is to strip them down to case/cpu/mainboard/ram.  Leaning to the other side, plenty of places to get $350 priced machines that met the performance requirement.  They just aren&#8217;t very quiet, and that was my opinion of them standing in Best Buy.  Which is not exactly a quiet environment to begin with.</p>

<p>Wandering around Best Buy, I did see one machine that fit well and I hadn&#8217;t really considered.  It was the Mac Mini.  This for some reason, just seems weird.  It very much feels like I am missing something.  There is this meme in my head that says that while the mac may have a nice interface, it isn&#8217;t the cheapest choice.  (<small>That and I am rather guessing that the mini probably on the lower end of bus and hard drive speeds.</small>)</p>

<p>This hardware stuff, it just boggles my mind.  Every time. See, I am a software guy, this hardware stuff, its all magic.  I mean, they put chips in little black boxes for a reason.  I really would rather not think about it at all if I could. I really just want to walk in somewhere and walk out with a working machine that meets my requirements.</p>

<p>This is about where I start looking at colos, web hosting services, and those nifty virtual host companies.  Never can quite get what I want for a price I&#8217;m comfortable with though.  Part of it is being cheep, part of it is that there is a lot of idle time.  </p>

<p>Anyways, it took a while, but I finally got a machine together that fits my requirements.  It really just took me doing what I probably should have done right from the beginning.  I drove down past campus, out to <a href="http://www.nanosys1.com">General NanoSystems</a>.  I&#8217;ve been in there so often with friends and my brothers, I should have thought of it quicker.  In any case, I walked in, told them what I wanted.  They put it together, did the CPU and memory test, and I walked out with my new system.</p>

<p>So, that part is finished.  Now to finish redesigning and figure out how to layer the static stuff onto this.  Such fun.</p>
