Books on shelves...

...What will they think of next?

This was actually a combined birthday and Christmas gift, which was spread out over the four months between.  But did rather work out, since being custom made, measurements and such were took in August, and around Christmas time, the shelves were finished.

There was also a mini-party of sorts where people helped me put all of the books onto the shelves.  In no apparent order of course, so now I just need to go through and reorder them all.  This is actually harder than it sounds, since I keep starting to read the books I take off the shelf before I put it back.  Some serious self control will have to be found before I properly face this task.  (<small>though, they did sit in boxes for almost two years, so it should hurt to be out of order for another two?</small>)
