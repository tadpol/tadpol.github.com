<p>I&#8217;m mostly just updating because I want something else on the front page.  So, what should I mumble about; how about some of the projecty stuff I&#8217;m killing free time with.</p>

<p>Well, one thing that has been hampering updates, is that I&#8217;m rewriting the engine that renders my site. (<small>yes, again.</small>)  Previous design wasn&#8217;t very flexible for future adjustments.  Not that I was stopped by this, but it had gotten to the point where adding in one more kludge broke all sorts of strange things.  As I was sifting through it trying to clear things up, it occurred to me it would just be easier to rewrite things; so I am.  Unfortunately it means I&#8217;m in-between two not entirely working engines.  (<small>if you&#8217;re wondering how I made this post then, the answer is with lots and lots of duck tape.</small>)</p>

<p>Another things that I have been throwing time into is my <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/channel/ds">NDS</a>.  I picked up a <a href="http://www.r4ds.com/index-en.htm">R4</a> before August, and have been playing around with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_homebrew">homebrew</a> stuff.  At the moment I&#8217;m working to port <a href="/projects/threes.html">Three&#8217;s</a> over to it.  To simplify things, I decided to use <a href="http://www.dslua.com/">DSLua</a> instead of jumping right into the raw C stuff.  I have the game core logic finished, and am currently a bit stuck getting graphics to come up.  The images need to be converted into NDS format, and I&#8217;m having some troubles with the tools that compile on the Mac.  I&#8217;m not sure if there was something bad with the compile, or if I&#8217;m using the wrong options when I call the tool.  As soon as I get this working, I&#8217;ll add a projects page for it.</p>
