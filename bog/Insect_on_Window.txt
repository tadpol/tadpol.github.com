Insect on Window
#created 2006-06-23T16:23:22-05:00

A insect landed on my window, and stayed there.  When I first say it I thought it would make a neat picture, but there is noway it would stay long enough for me to go get my camera.  So I sat down a read a book for a while.  When I looked up, it was still there.  So I went and got my camera and took its picture anyways.
