Evil Little Scratches
#created Mon Jan 23 21:13:00 CST 2006

The pains of buying used I guess; evil little scratch.  Just a tiny one,
but its deep.  The real bummer of it is, that the game played fine up
almost the end.  It dies right after the start of chapter five, and
chapter six is the final bosses.  *sigh* I even tried using brass
polish.  I know it helped, because that's one damn shiny disc now.  It
used to have all sorts of little scuffs.  Now its super shiny, with one
small, deep scratch.

[Musashi][] was fun
too.  But I guess I won't be finishing this one. *sigh* well, I've
whined, off to something else now.
