whee! I <em>finnally</em> got around to replacing the clock battery on
my Ingido R4k.  It has only been dead for about a year. (<small>High
importantce this machine has, can you not tell?</small>) Turns out to be
rather straight forward.  A little wheezy because the battery is
soldered down instead of socketed.  But that went pretty quick.  Super
helpful to have found some <a
href="http://g-lenerz.de/sgistuff/documents/indigo-battery-faq.txt">
basic instructions</a> on what needed to be done.  Which was found with
google's help, since it isn't like the indigo gave a useful error,
&ldquo;Can't set tod clock.&rdquo;  Sounds kind of funny when you say it
aloud, but hardly points one in the direction of a dead battery. 
Anyways, the indigo boots now, and there is happiness.

<p>There is something very oddly comforting to hear the whine of the SCSI2 drives in the old machine.  And at the same time, I know very well that in about an hour, the noise will start to drive me nuts.  The machine boots.  The clock is corrected.  It is halted, and packed away again.  I have no place but the middle of the floor for it right now.

<p>Perhaps I'll have a place for it in my new place.</p>
