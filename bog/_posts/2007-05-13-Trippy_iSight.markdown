Was just messing around with my iSight, since its been packed away for a while.  Thought crossed my mind, what happens if I pointed it at the screen?

<!-- height is 240 + 16, or movie height plus controller height. -->
<p><embed width="320" height="256"
       src="/moovs/trippy.mov"
       controller="TRUE"
       autoplay="false"
       border="0"
       pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/indext.html"
       target="myself"></embed></p>


Ah, that's what will happen.
