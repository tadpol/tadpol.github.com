<p>
Just finally finished ripping out all of the plain text email addresses of my
site.  Major pain in ass that I cannot trust my email address to float on the
web safely.  The only few places where I do still have visible adress links are 
hidden with this neat app that encodes your adress into some javascript.  
Then you just inline that where you want the link to be.  It is called
<a href="http://www.hiveware.com/enkoder.php">enkoder</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am quite split about this though.  It now means that you *must* have working
javascript enabled web browser to see the mailto link.  I'm not worlds happy 
about that.  On the other hand, I much much more dislike the twenty to fourty
spams I am getting a day.
</p>
<p>
I hope this thins that out.  I really do.
</p>
<p>
The only other bit that bothers me, is that it is only a matter of time before
the losers that are farming the web for email addresses upgrade their crap 
and are able to parse this apart too.
