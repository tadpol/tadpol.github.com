Simple little things I discovered while trying to take some close up pictures of a [Technics model][NXT].  There is a lot of white shiny plastic parts in the set, so it pretty much always washes out with the flash.  Solution is to cover the bottom half of the flash with my finger.  Had to use my cell phone to take a picture of my camera, but a picture really shows what I mean best.

So you can see, here are two shots using this trick. First without, then with.  Definitely falls under the hack/kludge category, but good enough for what I needed.
