<p>Or rather just attaching my 
<a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/etrexVenture/">GPS unit</a> 
onto my bicycle.  Many people just go and get one of those little
digital things that tell them how far, and how fast.  I was going to get
one of those too, but then I remembered, that hey, I've got this GPS
thing that I only really use when I vacation.  And you know, that will
tell you how far and how fast and which direction and elevation.
And then you can go and <a href="http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/">build maps</a> 
of where you've been afterwards! 
(<small>Technophile? why yes, thank you.</small>) </p>
<p>
This is just too entertaining, I might pop.
</p>
<p>This is also where I start to think it is a good reason I don't have
a GPS Unit that can show color maps.  I'd never watch where I was going,
just looking at the screen instead. (<small>And that's just an accident
waiting to happen.</small>) </p>
