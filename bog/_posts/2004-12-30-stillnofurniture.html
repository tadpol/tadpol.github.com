<p>
I don&#8217;t know what happened to November.  If anyone else does,
I&#8217;d appreciate some hints.  December is however, what it always
is, the Holiday Season.  Which just somehow equates to being overly
busy.  Even so this is by far one of the more relaxing 12<sup>th</sup>
months I&#8217;ve had in a long time.  We weren&#8217;t about to all
lose our jobs again. (<small>Startups are so much fun, aren&#8217;t
they?</small>)  It was a nice change not having to worry about that.
(<small>Hurray for being part of a largish publicly traded company.</small>)
</p>

Of course, what I was really hoping to be able to put up was some
pictures of my new furniture.  However, as the title pretty clearly
indicates, it still hasn&#8217;t shipped.  Frankly, I am not impressed. 
The sales guy did say that it should all be ready by the
15<sup>th</sup>, and so I thought I was all good.  Well before things
got too crazy with Christmas and all.  But no, its the 30<sup>th</sup>,
and still no word.

<p>So this is going to just end here, while I go off and pout.</p>
