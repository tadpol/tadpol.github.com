Way up in the sky (hands thrown up) <br/>
The little birds fly (fly with your hands) <br/>
Way down in the nest (rock your arms, like holding a baby) <br/>
The little birds rest (rest head on hands, &lsquo;sleeping&rsquo;) <br/>

SHHH! (whispered) They&rsquo;re SLEEPING! (shouted as loud as you can)

The bright sun comes up (make a loop over your head with arms) <br/>
The dew falls away (falling dew with hands) <br/>
Good morning, good morning (throw up hands at each &lsquo;good morning&rsquo;) <br/>
The little birds say <br/>
