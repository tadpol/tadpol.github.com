There has not been one there for too long, and I have
greatly missed having one on my presence.  Took a while to find a suitable 
one though.  Relatively impossible to find a physical store that sells them,
so to the online world.  Then trying to find one that is usable.  They make
a lot of nice pocket watches that would never make it more then a week or two
under real use.  (<small>You know, like putting it in your pocket everyday.</small>)
</p>
<p>They build those watches to look good, and while they're at it, they throw in
the ability to keep time too.  Icky.  But after much digging, I find the steel ones.
Then had to dig some more.  As I learned from my last pocket watch, if the knob on top 
sticks out too much, it gets caught on things.  After getting caught a few times, it 
will just come right off.  So to find one that has a knob you can grab, but doesn't
stick out so much it gets caught everywhere.  I found one.
</p>
<p>It does not surprise me at all that it took the U.S. Army to design a watch that 
is practical.</p>
