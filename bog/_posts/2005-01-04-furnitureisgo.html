<p>
Hurray! My furniture is here!  The final piece got to the warehouse last friday,
so I got it scheduled to be delivered this morning.  And now it is here.
</p>
<p>
So then, pictures.  I just kind of pushed things to about where they might be, 
and dropped a few extra pillows that the previous owners left behind.
(<small>The pillows have a pattern that is similar to the walls in the kitchen.</small>)
Things may move more yet. Will wait and see.
