<p>Should you ever get a mental lasp and decide that you can take four 5xxx Csci and a 
part time job, you will find that watching computers compute things like 
the following completely fascinating.</p>
<hr size=6>

<p>This was supposed to converge if you did the ( .9 .* Out2) thing, it didn't for me. :)<br>
<small>ok, can you tell I'm getting burned out?</small></P>

TRAINBPX: Network error did not reach the error goal.
  Further training may be necessary, or try different
  initial weights and biases and/or more hidden neurons.
