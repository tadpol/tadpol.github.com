On my way back to the cities this weekend, I saw a steam passenger train running along the road.  So I grabbed my phone quick and took a couple of shots.  You can see that I'm doing this while trying to drive.  Watching all the other vehicles engaged in the similar activity only made it more entertaining.  (<small>and kinda scary since everyone wasn't really watching each other, and there was quite the car-pack near the train.</small>)
