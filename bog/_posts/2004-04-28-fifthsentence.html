<p>This is way too intriguing not to do myself.  Found this via 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/24/FifthSentence">Tim Bray</a></p>

<ol>
	<li>Grab the nearest book</li>
	<li>Open the book to page 23</li>
	<li>Find the fifth sentence</li>
	<li>Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions</li>
</ol>

<p>From <em>Ice Mage</em> by Julia Gray, page 23, fifth sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
By contrast, his father was a solid, brooding presence, his still handsome 
face turned to wordless stone.
</blockquote>

<p>Spread the fun.</p>
