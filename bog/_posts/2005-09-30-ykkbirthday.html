I've gotten in the habit of getting something big-ish each year for myself on my birthday.
Last year, I got myself a nice <a href="usarmypocktwatch.html">watch</a>.
This year I decided to get the entire collection of Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou. (<small>finally.</small>)
The set finally arrived today.  I also couldn't stop myself from getting the art book too.  Now that
I've paged through it once, I'm glad I did.

<p>Anyways, here are the books, as a sort of recorded proof:</p>
