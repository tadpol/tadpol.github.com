For me books are food, and I haven't been eating enough lately.  When I
do finally get one, I devour it in an afternoon.  (<small>which does
sometimes bleed into the late night.</small>)  The trick is that I
actually have plenty of books that I've started reading laying around. 
Its just that they are all heavy tech books.  Lots of fiber.  So when I
do pick up something sweet, its gone in a snap.  Which just seems to
leave me hungering for more.

So I'm trying to read more fun stuff without gorging myself.  Which I
did sort of manage to do this weekend.  After inhaling <i>Men at
Arms</i> on Friday, I did manage to force myself to take two days to
read <i>Paper Mage</i>.  I think they were both good, its hard to tell
when I read them that fast.  (<small>Does it count against me that I
also read <i>All-New Tenchi Muyo: Picture Book</i> on Sunday as well?
Probably.</small>)  Sigh, four-ish books in three days? and now I'm here
with nothing fun to read again.
