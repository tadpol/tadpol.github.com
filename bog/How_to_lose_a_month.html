<p>First, start the month with <a href="/bog/Appendicitis.html">appendicitis</a>.  Then, just about when you thinks are all good, end up in <a href="http://www.northmemorial.com/ets/">ER</a> again because of infection complications.  Full proof that not only does <a href="http://www.accentstainlesssteel.com/gallery-pics/sand/Sand%20Laden%20Scrape%20Manure%20Fair%20Oaks%20Dairy.JPG">animal refuse</a> happen, sometimes it <a href="http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/ip/ip71/04%20liquid%20manure.jpg">flies all over</a>. blarghs.</p>

<p>I cannot say too much about the first part of my twelve day hospital stay.  All I really remember is hurting, and getting painkillers.  Repeatedly.  Then once again, I was inspected by a <a href="http://www.healthcentral.org/outpatienttesting/catscan.php">cat</a>, and it found two big <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/abscess?cat=health">abscesses</a>.  Like baseball and softball big.  So they installed some external <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson-Pratt_drain">drains</a> to let the pus out, and set me up on some powerful antibiotics.  This is when my awareness kicked back in and I started improving.</p>

<p>Five-ish days later, I was finally well enough to be let out and heal at home.  Still had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson-Pratt_drain">drains</a> installed.  Also needed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICC_line">picc line</a> installed since one of the antibiotics was IV only.  So got setup with all that, and trained a bit on using it.  Setup home health care so nurses stop by periodically.  Then slowly and surely start putting life back together.</p>

<p>Mostly this is the steady work of rebuilding stamina.  The first couple of days out of the hospital I had to take a nap after eating because just the task of eating tired me out.  Walking wasn&#8217;t much fun either.  But with time, I&#8217;m now to the point where I only take one or two short naps a day.  I&#8217;m walk short distances more because of the irritation of the muscles around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson-Pratt_drain">drains</a> than because of getting tired.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m steadily improving, but still not on top of things.  August is nearly over; I don&#8217;t remember about half of it, and the other half I am just lying low and recovering.</p>

<p><strong>Updated: 2007-08-31T16:38:03-05:00</strong> Woohoo! I got both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson-Pratt_drain">JP Drains</a> removed this morning.  Now just a week or so of the IV antibiotic, then the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICC_line">picc line</a> should be coming out.  I&#8217;m ecstatic. </p>
