<p>Fun weekend.  My friend Jeff got married to Sofia, a lovely gal that
hails from Mexico.  As such, the wedding was in her home town of
Guadalajara.  Unfortunately, I forgot to bring my camera, so I&#8217;ve no
pictures. (<small>well, there is one lame attempt with my phone, but its
a last second oh-yeah-my-phone-has-a-camera shot that isn&#8217;t all that
good.</small>)  Perhaps others will put some up and I can just link
them.</p>

<p>Lots of neat little differences between the two cultures in the
celebration of marriage, but still quite familiar over all.  They listed
a handful of these in the program, but I forgot to take a copy so I&#8217;m
working from memory here.  Perhaps the most notable to us from the
states is that they don&#8217;t do rehearsals.  Also instead of clinking
silverware to glasses, they had a phrase they chanted.</p>

<p>Then there was the Mariachi bands.  The night before the wedding, a
bunch of us went with Jeff to get a Mariachi band so he could serenade
his fianc&eacute;e.  The next day, another one played for a time at the
reception.  You can tell that these bands are a big part of the culture
both by the number of them, and that most people seem to know the words
sung.  (<small>course I&#8217;m guessing a bit there, not knowing spanish, its
hard to say how well people were signing along.</small>)</p>

<p>I do need to note, real mexican food heaps great shame upon the stuff up
here in the states that carries the same label.  Which I guess should be
expected, but going to mexican restaurants around here will now forever
be a bit of a let down.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a fun weekend.  Best wishes and highest happiness for
both Jeff and Sofia in their union.</p>
