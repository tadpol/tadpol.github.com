<p>Read through the <a href="http://inessential.com/2004/03/26.php">teasers</a> that Brent
dropped on the new <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>, looking neat. 
Though I cannot say I'm all that excited about the Browsing in Place
thing.  </p>

<p>Even though I do fall into the "Do one thing and do it well" camp,
that's not where I'm taking issue.  My concern is that I look at the
tiny little viewing area in NNW that each post is in, then I look over
at the huge viewing area that my web browser gives me.  Then I look at
most blogs' web page verses the rawer data they give to rss.  And I just
have to wonder, where are all of the side bars gonna go?(<small>Answer
is nowhere, they'll just squish the text you want to read into a column
of words.</small>)</p>

<p>There isn't exactly a lot of room to work with there.  (<small>And
no, making the NNW window bigger isn't really an option.  Apps that have
windows that take up the whole screen are bad in my little
world.</small>)</p>

<p>The weblog editor updates are of some interest though.  I've been
doing a lot of work lately to stream line the way my site builds. 
Mostly trying to remove all of the work in adding a page. 
(<small>Easier added pages make for easier posts, and I'm trying to be
more, umm, bloggish?</small>)  And being able to make new entries
without having to do a lot of html tagging by hand would be a nice plus.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm still using <a href="http://www.barebones.com/">BBEdit</a>, then making use of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> to pull
it up into full html.  But there are a lot of -isms around here that
just don't fit well with text2html processors.  The biggest is my making
text in parentheses smaller.  Now I could hack Markdown I suppose, but
really, it would be a lot cleaner mentally to write text, select text,
make text smaller.  (<small>Although, having it happen automatically
might be easier, though it may end up being unexpected at
times.</small>)  This nice thing about Markdown, it leaves all of
my hand included html alone.</p>

<p>The big downer to any weblog editor is that I'm running custom code
to build things.  Just meaning that if I do find one I like, I'll
still have to write up some scripts to make it actually work.  Oh well,
my own darn fault.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to NNW.  I'm a little disappointed he didn't say
anything about the feature that I <em>really</em> want.  And that's
being able to share/transfer the list of read posts between home and
work.  I follow a couple of blogs at work that I don't at home, and a
bunch at home that I don't at work, and then a handful that get peeked
at from both.  Ending up reading some posts twice is just kind of
irritating.  (<small>Mostly because I'm also a developer, so I know
there has to be a solution.  I've tried to hack it too, and let me tell
you, NNW <em>really</em> gets unhappy when you start messing with the
underlying sqlite database.</small>)  Making use of MacOS's built in
spell checker would be quite swell too.</p>

<p>I guess I'll just have to wait and see.</p>
