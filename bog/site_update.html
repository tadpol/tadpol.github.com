<p>Right, so if you haven&#8217;t noticed by now, I updated my web site.  Massive changes were made.  The back end is now dynamic driven with Typo.  It is a rather nice piece of code.  I&#8217;ve been playing with it for a couple of months before I decided to go with it.  Had to write up a custom importer to get the data from my old site in.  Then wrote a variant of that importer to generate a whole bunch of Redirect commands for Apache.  So all the old links should give a 301 and then the new location.</p>

<p>Except, that is, for the parts of the site that are still static.  Those bits are linked in with Alias directives. (<small>Yeah, those would be the &#8220;Other Things&#8221; over on the right there.</small>)  Still going over things and making sure everything is working.  I&#8217;d say I have that done too, but as soon as I do, something will pop up.</p>

<p>Then the whole front end of things.  Basically, I got tired of black.  (<small>Weird, I know.</small>)  Played with a lot of different colors and such, but nothing really worked.  Then as I&#8217;m passing a mirror, it clicks into my brain what I was wearing, olive green sweatshirt, khaki cargo pants, and a black t-shirt.  My brain went, &#8220;duh.&#8221; and I put those colors into the site.  Seems to have worked out pretty well I think.</p>

<p>There was also a lot of work on an image that was gonna fill the space at the top.  Never could get it to work out like what is lurking in my head though.  I am going to keep trying for a while, but the traces of code in the background works.  Might just leave it like this.  (<small>Ah, but the gears and vines of circuitry would have been so neat.</small>)</p>

<p>So, upgrade and redesign are pretty much done, save for a few minor tweaks here and there.  Feels good to have it finished.</p>
