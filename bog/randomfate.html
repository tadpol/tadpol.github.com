<p>
There are a few things that always create a strange sense of wonder in
me.  Its that kind of wonder that lends one to thoughts of greater
grander type things.  Trying to see the larger picture from just a few
shuffled pieces of a puzzle.  Something like that.
</p>

<p>
In particular, when I somewhat randomly just take off somewhere.  And
then go and wonder aimlessly around for a bit.  Just to change the
scenery and stuff.  And out while I'm somewhere else being aimless, I
should happen upon someone I know.  More importantly, someone that I'm
rather quite sure still takes residency in the same city that I do.  It
just odd to run into someone that way.  Given the number of people that
one can see in any given city scape.
</p>

<p>
What really gives it that weird larger picture feeling is a commonalty. 
That bit of info that comes up after you've got to talking a bit.  That
bit where all involved are just kind of <em>bleh</em> with things, so
you all just sort of took off for the day.  My mind turns on this.
</p>

<p>
Is there something in air?  The water?  Some larger fluctuation in
something that most people don't believe?  The hand of someone that most
pretend to believe?  What kind of thing draws this kind of chance
together?  Is it just coincidence, or is there more to it than that?
</p>

<p>
The chance of both being there, then.  The timing involved.  If I had
walked a few steps farther before turning around.  Hadn't stopped for a
cup of coffee.  Hadn't listened to someone there about blues music for
much longer than I had intended.  If our car's hadn't been in adjacent
lots.  The insane number of factors just within a few minutes and few
yards that alone could have separated the chance meeting.
</p>

<p>
Never to even start the thought on the grander scale.  The numerous
volume of data just in the tiny set of space and time around the event
that could have changed.  Which then would have prevented the event
entirely.  But to begin on the data that stretches beyond.  The events
just to have known the person.  The events to have sent me spiraling out
on that day.  The events that sent them out.  And all of the timing on
those events.  And the place.
</p>

<p>
Although, through all of that, the place seems the easiest to explain. 
This is because of some other property that places seem to exhibit.  How
some places draw towards people, draw them in.  Looking through all of
the stuff that depends on that chance meeting, the place met is the
least confusing.  Its not the first time I've been drawn there, and I
rather doubt this will be the last.  Besides, its hard to miss a lake
that big.
</p>

<p>
Even so, this only explains (<small>well deals with at the
least</small>) one bit of the world sized ocean of bits.  It ends up
being a lot like pissing into the sea to raise the oceans.  It was a lot
inside of you, but now its lost within the rest.
</p>

<p>
And yet, my mind reels on the randomness that fate produces at times.
