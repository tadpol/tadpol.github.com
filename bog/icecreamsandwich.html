wow.  I had forgotten how good ice cream sandwiches are.  I don't remember
the last time I had one.  Must of been middleschool.  I doubt any sooner
than that, was sometime about the start of highschool that I just gave up
on the lactase stuff. (<small>For those that did not know, I'm lactose
intolerant.</small>)  Given the choices, you quickly learn to just not eat
certain things.  Most of them you find you don't miss.
</p><p>
Not the case for ice cream.  I missed ice cream.  Much so that for a long
time, the only reason I still kept trying to use the lactaid pills was for
the creamy goodness.  I finally gave up though, I'm still convinced that
those pills just don't work.  Literally a pain in the gut. (<small>and ass
for that matter.</small>)  I just accepted that I would have to do without,
unhappily.
</p><p>
So then, many years later, a friend whom recently determinned that he is
also unable to drink the white posion, points me to this Moca-Mix stuff.
Fake ice cream.  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmFakeIceCream.  As far as I can tell, it
tastes simular, but then its been almost a decade since I have had the real
stuff.  In any case, I had to make some cookies and have me a fake ice
cream sandwich.   mmmmmmHappiness.  (<small>Ok, so I had three.  I've got
some year to catch up for. ^_^</small>).
