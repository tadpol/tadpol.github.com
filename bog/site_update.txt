Site Update
#created Tue Oct 25 15:14:00 CDT 2005

Right, so if you haven't noticed by now, I updated my web site.  Massive changes were made.  The back end is now dynamic driven with Typo.  It is a rather nice piece of code.  I've been playing with it for a couple of months before I decided to go with it.  Had to write up a custom importer to get the data from my old site in.  Then wrote a variant of that importer to generate a whole bunch of Redirect commands for Apache.  So all the old links should give a 301 and then the new location.

Except, that is, for the parts of the site that are still static.  Those bits are linked in with Alias directives. (<small>Yeah, those would be the "Other Things" over on the right there.</small>)  Still going over things and making sure everything is working.  I'd say I have that done too, but as soon as I do, something will pop up.

Then the whole front end of things.  Basically, I got tired of black.  (<small>Weird, I know.</small>)  Played with a lot of different colors and such, but nothing really worked.  Then as I'm passing a mirror, it clicks into my brain what I was wearing, olive green sweatshirt, khaki cargo pants, and a black t-shirt.  My brain went, "duh." and I put those colors into the site.  Seems to have worked out pretty well I think.

There was also a lot of work on an image that was gonna fill the space at the top.  Never could get it to work out like what is lurking in my head though.  I am going to keep trying for a while, but the traces of code in the background works.  Might just leave it like this.  (<small>Ah, but the gears and vines of circuitry would have been so neat.</small>)

So, upgrade and redesign are pretty much done, save for a few minor tweaks here and there.  Feels good to have it finished.
