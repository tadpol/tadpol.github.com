I got my Wii

I remember saying, at least once, that the people that would wait in line before a store opened for a product are nuts, and I would never do such a thing.



Apparently, I lied.



Someday I will learn not to say that I would never do something.  Not, mind you, that I really understand why I stood in line.  It was fricking cold. (9&ordm;F) I was only out there for 40 minutes. (<small>as if that somehow makes it better.</small>) They handed out tickets twice, once before I got there, and once about 20 minutes before opening.  And there were people turned away at the end of the line.  So I don't feel *too* bad about standing in line.



Anyways, I now have a [Wii][], which came with [Wii Sports][wiisports].  Also picked up [Wii Play][wiiplay] (<small>comes with extra remote</small>), [Raving Rabbids][rabbids], and [Zelda][twilightprincess] for games.  Then a classic controller, and an extra Nunchuk.



The name is a bit off though, pretty much just because there are so many massively wrong ways to take it.  I mean, really, what *does* someone mean if they ask if you want to come over and play with their Wii?
