<p>Nothing quite destroys a well planned weekend like a <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/appendicitis/article.htm">body part failing</a>.  <a href="http://www.accentstainlesssteel.com/gallery-pics/sand/Sand%20Laden%20Scrape%20Manure%20Fair%20Oaks%20Dairy.JPG">Organically-grown-animal-refuse</a> happens I guess. (<small>and sometimes its not organic either.</small>)  Started to feel some pain Aug 1, Wednesday afternoon; timed right such that I thought it was minor food poisoning.  Things didn&#8217;t really get better by the evening, so I hopped over to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urgent_care">Urgent Care</a>.  They basically said if its something minor, you&#8217;ll feel better tomorrow.  If it isn&#8217;t, then you&#8217;ll be in <a href="http://www.northmemorial.com/ets/">ER</a>.</p>

<p>I was a stubborn idiot, and waited for the pain to go away most of Thursday.  It didn&#8217;t.  So off to <a href="http://www.northmemorial.com/ets/">emergency room</a>.  They had me drink some dye, and then be inspected by a cat.  <a href="http://www.healthcentral.org/outpatienttesting/catscan.php">Cat-scan</a> showed that my appendix was disgruntled and was making a fuss.  Best thing was to get it out quickly.  So that&#8217;s what we did.</p>

<p>Most of Friday is a haze.  Anesthesia and pain killers do that.  People came by, people called, and later I found people emailed.  Thank you all.</p>

<p>I do remember one thing.  It is common in men, as they age, to have problems peeing after anesthesia.  There is much long about this that boils down to a single word: <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/foley_catheter/article_em.htm">catheter</a>.  Which is directly translated into <strong>OUCH</strong>.  Intensely in so many ways.  I also soon learned another neat fact.  My bladder at full holds about a liter and a half of urine.  I could have done without learning that.</p>

<p>Once I remembered how to pee, I was released.  My brothers and parents were all up this weekend for other reasons anyways, so everyone was around to help while I started recovery.  Each day out I&#8217;m a bit better, but I&#8217;m still moving slow.  Will also need to be careful for the next couple of weeks at least.</p>

<p>Oh, and double thanks to my brother who drove me to ER, and then waited until I was out of surgery sometime 3am before going home.  It is massively awesome to have family like you.</p>
